Welcome to my world and then see me there.
The glory that no one denies.
You've conquered death, that's all I know.
All my love long run down.

Bring in the lion, the wizard and king.
Bring out the dead or the loved ones.
'Cause I know we all live a lie.
Where do they really belong?
We're living a life of glorious dreams.
The once and future king.

Let them curse my name
on these bloodstained pages of misery.
And the torment will never let loose.
Let them curse my name
and remember the truth.

Down below where the stories are flying high
they watch your step and then fly back to me.
All my magic's fulfilled in rhymes.
Rearranged for the way.
So I'll let you feel the way for a while,
but I will not let you down.

Alone I want to be, there's no sign of Avalon.
The elder, they all know, there's no sign of Avalon.
No tomorrow I will sing.
No tomorrow I will sing.

There I walk.
I'm afraid it's not on me.
Walk in the shadows.
My piper will come.
Curse the wind. They know my name.
Lovers don't go there, these passes to me.

Let them curse my name
on these bloodstained pages of misery.
And tomorrow will never come true.
Let them curse my name
and remember the truth.

They don't like to see.
They don't want to be.
Don't ask me what they long for.
Suddenly time runs backwards.

All my magic's fulfilled in rhymes.
Rearranged for the way.
So I'll let you feel the way for a while,
but I will not let you down.

Now I know we all live a lie,
no matter her whithering wings.
And while we walk in pouring rain
life's passing by.

Let them curse my name
on these bloodstained pages of misery.
Let them turn all the pages we knew.
Let them curse my name
and remember the truth.

The death of the king will come.
For all that I knew you would come.
It's part of the bigger seed
but we will stand proud
to my beloved time.
