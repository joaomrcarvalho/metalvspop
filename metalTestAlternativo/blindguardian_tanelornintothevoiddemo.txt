We travel in silver and gold.
We're coming from the land of the iron.
A tortured mask of the wise I behold.
My story has never been told.

Into the fire.
Curse me.
Beware.
Into the fire.
Everything's gone.

This time the battle we have won,
but we are lost 'cause we have chosen.

Take me to the tower of the universe.
Give them back to places where I should have gone.

Please let me cry for everyone.
Do not fear their voices.
Cry for everyone.
Do not fear your choices.
We have enough.
We have enough.
Feeling their voices come so clean.
Cry for everyone.
I feel I'm falling down into the storm.

Look at the siren.
I trust the fire is not what it seems.
When terror is raging.
I am not alone.

Here on my own I've left the world on fire.
Here on my own I'm wasting life so sweet.
My shadow soul, my war cry.
Someone gets near.

Deceiver.
Deceiver.

Now look at the siren.
I've turned to fire, it's raging my soul.
Terror is raging even more.

Now I cry for everyone.
Do not fear their voices.
Cry for everyone.
Do not fear your choices.
We have enough.
We have enough.
Fading, their voices come so clean.
Cry for everyone.
I feel I'm falling down into the storm.

We travel in silver and gold.
We're coming from the land of the iron.
A torture-ridden past from the wise I behold. [?]
My story has never been told.

Into the fire.
Tell me.
Live on.
Into the fire.
Everything's gone.

Inside the fire.
I'm called through desire.
Don't brave the children of the dark.

Please let me cry for everyone.
Do not fear their voices.
Cry for everyone.
Do not fear your choices.
We have enough.
We have enough.
Fading, their voices come so clean.
Cry for everyone.
I feel I'm falling down into the storm.

Believer.
I'm damned.
Believer.
