It's warm and tender but very soon it will turn cold
Shadows stare down from the walls
Out of the mist it's coming closer now
It never rains -- it pours on me
So let the saints
Set up the courtyard, the unpleasant cage
The obvious point is I'm insane

Was I aware whom I has slain, I fear I was:
The faceless
The nameless
The bush set on fire
No one ever dared to speak
"Shame on me, I don't believe
The here and now Is all we're living for"

Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Vanished to the point of no return

Witness my last breath
I do not regret
A word I've said
The strong will survive
The weak must die

And out of the mist
It's coming closer now
Sinner and saints --
The grateful slaves

Nature's law instead of God in heaven

From far beyond
I can hear them sing
I hear angels sing
Songs of innocence
I hear the angel sing

Despite the facts are clear
It cannot be, what we can't see
I must admit, it sounds so sweet

Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Vanished to the point of no return

Angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing

Far beyond I hear them sing
("It's true) it's true
We don't exist"
From far beyond I hear them sing
("It's true) it's true
We don't exist"

Well we all know there's no other side
It's good and evil
I know right between, there's no borderline
This is the punishment divine

Surrounded by night, I've been offered insight
There is none but the sin of pride
Am I wrong am I right? Am I losing my sight?
Abandoning the superior mind

Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Vanished to the point of no return

(Right away)
Through the valleys grey
(I will be gone)
Through the shapeless land I walk alone
(I will be gone)
I'm left alone
(I will be gone)
Through the deepest void, a blackened paradise
(I will be gone)
I walk alone, I'm left alone
