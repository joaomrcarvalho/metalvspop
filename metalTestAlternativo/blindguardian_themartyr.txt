He was born in the past time
To take all our pain
The kingdom of heaven's near
The children of this time
Must die for his arrive
To let all the legends be true
The prophecy said they'll call king of the Jews
He is born now to take all our sins
Three kings were searching for this holy child
The journey begins, he has to die

[Lead]

[Bridge]

Healing the cripples and taking our pain
He came for the sinner
But what we've said
Disciples are following
They are calling his words
Salt of the earth and light of the world

[Ref.:]
Martyr - we are following you
Bless us for eternity
Messiah - we are torturing you
When you lose the power of your words

Jump from the temple and angle will save
Show me that you are the son of our God
Now take my land with my power you get
Rulin' the world of tomorrow
Messiah liar our burning desire
He is the king without a crown
We'll set him to his throne
Give me 30 p of silver and I'll be your man
Higher liar the fallen Messiah
Let us see his agony
The things he done are blasphemy
Mob has lost their joy on toy
So let us kill him fast
Now drink my blood for the new testament
This is my body you eat
One of you twelve is the one who betrays
Better that he's never born
Judas you're the chosen one
The world has damned your name

[Lead]

[Bridge]

Begin with a kiss
At a cross it will end
The kingdom of heaven we've passed
The sky will turn black and the curtain will fall
The father's crying for his son
The tortured Messiah is finding his way
The journey has come to the end
The twelve ones are preaching the words he'd left
They're changing the way of the world but die for

Martyr - we are following you
