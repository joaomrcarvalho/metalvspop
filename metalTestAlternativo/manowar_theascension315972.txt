"Power of the Universe had sired a Son
He was baptized by Fire Water Earth and Sky
From darkness he rose up in Triumph
To ascend the Throne of Light
And He Alone shall forever be known
As the King of Kings"

I entered this World born under a sign of Infinite Light
and here I shall dwell
I now understand all that I am
Shall live in Thy command
