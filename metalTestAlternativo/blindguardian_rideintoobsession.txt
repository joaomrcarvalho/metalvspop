Come, I show you the end
You're dammed
Cause no one can defy me
Just watch these maddened creatures
Like you they all once reached out
A war to win
But I'm gonna burn this vision down

Call me the father of lies
Just watch these saddened creatures
they've torned you into their savior

You hold your ground
Until your last breath
You'll twist then turn
and now you're falling down

The battle rages on
And forever and ever
The wheel will turn

Let ages come and go
The will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another ride into obsession
I am reborn
The wheel will turn now
And I am driven to obsession

All these dying men
try to understand
They all followed the sign

Ir's a cyrcle's end
There no hope
for a while
 From the ashes arise

Can't save her
Enjoy the flames
So precious, so pure

and you try
You're sure to fail
And madness
Is the price you've to pay

Unholy grounds
Witness your last breath
The cyrcle ends
And you're stumbling

The battle will go on
and forever and ever
It's raging on

Let ages come and go
The wheel will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another ride into obsession
I am reborn
The wheel will turn now
And I'm driven to obsession

Through the flames you'll see me
You'll be mine, believe me
This is the moment I long for

Wake up there's a storm to face and
Right now while the land lies bleeding
It's me, I conquer your soul

Still I'll be on my way
Oh light, let me out of here I pray

And over and over and over again
There is no beginning
No end

This war, it still goes on
And forever and ever
I will return

Let ages come and go
The wheel will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another ride into obsession
I am reborn
The wheel will turn now
And I'm driven to obsession

Light - so serene
True source reign over me
There's no end and
There's no beginning
"You will never be alone"
