When the sky is burning,
see the Moon falling down.
On your right is lightning.
See the war in the sky.

Remember Brian,
when it's time.
Remember Brian.

[Guitar solo]

All our empty heads
discover the war in the sky.
Don't need no revolution
by the birthday of Brian.

Remember Brian,
when it's time.
Remember Brian.

When the end is nearing,
see him hanging on the cross.
A war in the sky
now by the ending of Brian.

Remember Brian,
when it's time.
Remember Brian.
