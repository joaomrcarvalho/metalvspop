I have seen the fire
Of the thousands suns pass by
While blasphemers spread their Gospel
Bearing false witness
Now we rise
All ye children of the wild
Fists like hammers fill the air
Vast legions all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere

Holy, Holy War

Holy
We are fighting, fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Holy War
Baptized in Fire and Steel
Holy War
For the end we bring is soon
Holy War
Now face the storm
A Holy War

Brothers of metal know no masters
Metal's our religion
Take it to the grave
Rulers of the earth
Our dawn of glory
All reborn we live again
Hold true, ye sacred army
Our last battle is at hand
Sweep this dogs from our kingdom
Bless this ground, our holy land

Holy, Holy War

Holy
We are fighting, fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Holy War
Baptized in Fire and Steel
Holy War
For the end we bring is soon
Holy War
Now face the storm
A Holy War
