I'm not insane
That's how it seems though
Spiteful, cruel but wise beyond his age

My body fails
My soul will (rise)
The end of life's immortalized
Disease and agony
And I see death through golden eyes
(Beyond the door)
There's something more
It seems there's just one way

On through the heat
I've felt the touch of evil
I still feel
The icy claw in me

For a descent price I've banned kindness from my heart
The spirit of all truth and beauty pawned for my desire

And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise

I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind

And through the hour glass
Everything's grey, everyone's pale
Nor colour nor beauty will enlighten my heart
The seat of life's empty and cold

Cadaverous you all seem to me
Stillborn but you're still alive
You're still alive

Truth lies in loneliness
When hope is long gone by
I'll wipe out the bliss of the new age
And welcome you precious night

And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise

From a distant time voices echo in the hall
"Come and join us, enter life and everything is gone now"

And through the looking glass
I still fear mortality and
Its loss in the end
(Unlimited) power in my hands
("Mourn for his lost soul
He's cursed and condemned")
The claw of the dragon ascends

Each step I take mMay it hurt may It ache
Leads me further away from the past
But as long as I breathe (and) each smile on my bleak face
I'm on my way to find back to the Peace of mind

And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise

I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind
