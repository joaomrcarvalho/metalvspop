Follow the blind
Your journey, your last hope, it can begin
These passing dreams were real not fantasy
There are more things than we know Come take my hand

[Solo: Andre]

Searching for the talisman you'll find it
On another plane far from all time
Maybe you wonder while you see The same faces
Everywhere You can find yourself in it
'cause you're a part

I'm another Strange my feelings Where I am here For a short time
I remember I had been here

[Solo: Marcus]

[Ref:]
I'm alone, follow me!
Calling you, follow me!
I'm alone, follow me!
Follow the blind
Follow me
Follow me it's my time
Follow me
Follow the blind

Wandering in my darkest dreams Iron shadows are lurking at me
In this desert the tyrant's calling On the run to save my love
She's full of pain The queen is lying far behind
In an endless dream

[Solo: Andre]

Before I thought I was dreaming
A strange voice whispers in my ears
You're the rat in the trap
Return, pain will come to you

[Ref:] I'm alone...No!
