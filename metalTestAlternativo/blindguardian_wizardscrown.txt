Years ago I came back
this has been my hardest attack
A burning fire's in my brain
I could feel the deadly flame
Tales of the magic in my head
to a dark dream I fall in my mind
I hold the key of fortune
To feel the strange thing's in my mind
the stone of Ambar I must find
I'll take the chance that day

Halloween
Halloween - But there is no return on Halloween

I'm the servant of the Blind to cross the
realms of death
the gate is open wide you cannot close
His dungeons deep no place to hide
The times have changed he has to fight
In magic spell I fall
Illusions falling in my mind
But where's the key I cannot find
the ritual has begun

[Solo]

The battle has begun
the warlocks time has come
I pay the price I've to pay
Why haven't see the signs
I'm loosing now my life
but cannot die forever life
