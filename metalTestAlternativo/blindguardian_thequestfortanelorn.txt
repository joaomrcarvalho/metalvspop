By the ruins he stands
And he's waiting for me
To enter Tanelorn
His paths seem strange
But they're always planned
Seldom he succeeds
About his own fate

[Lead: Andre]

He tries to conquer it
Again and again
But at last he's almost
A ruined man
Not a king or God
Who's searching for
A place called Tanelorn
Far beyond your dreams

[Lead: Andre]

On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
He's waiting
He's waiting for me
He's waiting
He's waiting for me

[Lead: Kai]

Darkness falling down on me
Darkness - The eternal battle rises

I know the answers
Although they don't exist
I'm just a mortal illusion

On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn

[Solo: Kai]

So I'm his companion
Through space and through time
His eternal servant
He's calling me
So I must leave
To another life
To another world
Far beyond your dreams

[Lead: Kai]

To know the truth
Just for a while
He's longing for a place
Where he can find himself
Deliverance
It could be everywhere
How can he find
He's waiting for me
And for you
Tanelorn

On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
