Raise sails head for the open sea
With sails full of wind-our hearts
Overflowwith belief.

The quest for the grail to England
We sail,with our steel.We
Bring what was lost.If
Lives are the cost,let it be.

Strong she stands-reaching her
Hand.Brave and grant.On English
Ground-we were born.Proudly
We return.-To English shore.

Hail,Hail to England-
Hail,Hail,Hail.

We march from the hills
Down to London Town.-
Join Raise you hand-or hide
When we ride for the crown.

Signs of the hammer and
The black winds blow through
The night.Long was out wait
Our meetings with Fate is tonight.

Strong she stands-reaching her
Hand.Brave and grand.On English
Ground-we were born.Proudly
We return.-To english shore.

Hail, Hail to England-
Hail,Hail,Hail.

Standind tall-one and all-
Light the hall.

Years have passed-I've dreamed
of this day.
As we raise our hands-we
proudly say.

Hail,Hail to England-
Hail,Hail,Hail.
