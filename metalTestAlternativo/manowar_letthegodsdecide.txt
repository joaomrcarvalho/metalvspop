Warriors take the field
The battlefield of life
You cannot run
You cannot hide

I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods

Only one of us will win
and return to fight again

I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods

Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide

I've sworn an oath in blood to defend the land
and all who wish to test their steel well here I am

I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods

Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide
