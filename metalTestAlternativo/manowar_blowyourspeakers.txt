Wrote a letter to the M.T.V.
What's goin' on now
Don't ya care about me?
Send the same letter to the radio, Ha!
But my party went dead
Like a shot in the head

We all like it - Rock And Roll
We all want it - on your show
Play it loud  don't play it low
Blow Your Speakers with Rock And Roll

We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playin'
It just ain't worth sayin'
People want music to get'em movin'
We don't want labels
We want music on the cable

We all like it - Rock And Roll
We all want it - on your show
Play it loud  don't play it low
Blow Your Speakers with Rock And Roll
