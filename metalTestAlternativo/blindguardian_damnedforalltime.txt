[Lead: Andre]

Conquer the whole world to satisfy
Their lust for pain and terror
Disguise their faces to hide them
In the dark Determination

The oath on the runestaff is the highest
The ruin of a nation Step by step Destiny

[Lead: Andre]

Damned for all time - but what's time
Tales of the one who's born to change

And as the earth was old and cold
She closed her eyes and fell to sleep
Violation ruled the world
The dark kingdom's time

He's called Hawkmoon wearing a sign
Black jewel in his head
He's the one who's forever there
He's born a thousand times

[Ref:]
Damned for all time In every age he existed
Damned for all time In every future he'll live
For all time He's crying He's crying

Hey strange one I know you're standing there
The faces are they mine?
Are you out there?
Watch out for the day, friend I'll know your name
Hear my laughter

Oblivion - who's blowing the horn
Oblivion - who's killing the gods

[Ref:] Damned...

[Solo: Andre]

Dark kingdom's lost now. No pain storms the land
Strange things are happening. Changing of all planes
In the universe by a bad magician
To conquer the power of this magic
A place where truth waits must be found Tanelorn

Damned for all time - who am I?
Once I've been called Erekose

I was Elric - I'll be Corum I'm the prince of the south ice
Now I'm nothing Wait for someone Wait for Ilian No! I'm Hawkmoon

Oblivion - the war is eternal
Oblivion - the battle is endless

[Ref:] Damned...
