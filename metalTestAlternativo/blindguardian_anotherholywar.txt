I am god
The only one
I will bring back
Freedom to your heart
You won't believe
That blind can't see
No one else before me ever knew
The way to paradise
For another bloody crime
I shall return

I am your light on through the night

Why am I born
Will I fail to rise again
Another Crucifixion for
Another holy war
Can't stop what's going on
[Repeat]

Sooner or later you must understand
My words bring freedom
And rescue for man
What else,
To call me your Messiah
Oh, I wish there could be another way
Cross and nails are already prepared

My sell out
Waits till I'm crucified
I will die before my vision ends

Why am I born
Will I fail to rise again
Another Crucifixion for
Another holy war
Can't stop what's going on

[SOLO]

Wait for the dawn
To take me away
What will be if I fail
Another golden calve
Never, never ending
Pain and agony
Hit me, nail me make me god

Why am I born
Will I fail to rise again
Another Crucifixion for
Another holy war
Can't stop what's going on
[Repeat]
