No doubt, doubt

No longer need to hide it
I've found out who I am
I'm moved around in circles
I rise and fall again

I know it well
Every word I tell
Seems to make no sense at all

Words
Will heal it
Love
Will conquer the
Hearts of the hopeless the almighty is still alive

Risin' up from the heart of the desert
Risin' up from Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heat of the desert
Building up old Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heart of the desert
Risin' up from Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heat of the desert
Heading out for Jerusalem

I've gone beyond but there's no life
And there is nothing how it seems
I've gone beyond but there's no life
There is no healing rain in Eden
The empty barren wasted paradise
Let's celebrate the dawning of the Sun

I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my poor old Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can't change fate

Son of man
(You truly are mine)

Can't stand the pain
No more grief and misery
It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on

Father stop it now
We must stop it now

You really think you are half way up
I would not mind if you were right
(It's not sure)
I'd rather say you are half way down
So I am going to help you if I can

I've been caught in wilderness in wilderness
I've get out well
I found myself in desert lands in desert lands
But you've been on my mind

I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my poor old Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can't change truth

Rise up and follow me cause I will bring the light
Rise up and follow me wake up and clear your mind
I try to bring it back the seed of life
I try to bring it back the seal of light

So if you say there's no faith in man
You better keep in mind
That I can read between the lines
My heavy burden brings eyesight to the blind

I've been caught in wilderness in wilderness
I've get out well
I found myself in desert lands in desert lands
But you've been on my mind

I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my poor old Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can't change me
