Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...

I enter this world born under a sign of infinite light,
And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...
