There are signs on the ring which make me feel so down
There's one to enslave all rings to find them all in time
And drive them into darkness
Forever they'll be bound

Three for the Kings of the elves high in light
Nine to the mortal which cry

[Solo: Markus]

[Ref x2:]
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill

And there's no way out Mordor
Dark land under Sauron's spell
Threatened a long time
Threatened a long time

Seven rings to the gnomes in their halls made of stone
Into the valley
I feel down

One ring for the dark lord's hand sitting on his throne
In the land so dark where I have to go

[Solo: Markus]

Lord of the rings
