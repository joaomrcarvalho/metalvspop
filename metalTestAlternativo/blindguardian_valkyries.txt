To the gods of the north, I pray
And raise my cup for the fallen ones
Then I cry
In Valhalla they'll sing

Rain
Red blood keeps pouring down
Come Valkyries, join me on that final ride

Here I lie bleeding
Odin, I await thee

The battle rages on

New lines they're weaving
The future, the past and the present
They're one
They will reveal their mask
To show me a way to survive
This bitter war

Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in

And terror will now rule these lands

When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home

Destiny
A spinning wheel
The path of glory
Round and round
come join us
On your final ride to Asgard
Let's move on fast
allfather waits
So let's heed the final call

For now
We leave this world behind
It's over

All glory to the brave
Still blood will rain
Through storm and fire
Let war winds reign
It's the feast for the crows

Follow the light
Just follow the light
Or fade away

Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in
and terror will now rule these lands

When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home

We'll keep on weaving
We're crushing through lines
With our battering swords
We're marching on
Assign the brave
To survive
This bitter war

Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in

And terror will now rule these lands

When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
We'll heed the final call
A call to arms
The valkyries will guide us home

The finally I hear them say
Carry on
For Valhalla awaits you
