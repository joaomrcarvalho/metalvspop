Turn your head and see the fields of flames

(Don't move along)
He carries along
(Cause things they will go wrong)
From a distant place
(The end is getting closer)
He's on his way
(Day by day)
He'll bring decay
In shades of grey
We're doomed to face the night
Light's out of sight

Since we've reached the point of no return
We pray for the starlight we wait for the Moon
The sky is empty, alone in the unknown
we're getting nowhere

We have been betrayed by the wind and the rain
The sacred hall's empty and cold
The sacrifice made should not be done in vain
Revenge will be taken by Rome

We live a lie
Under the dying moon
Pale-faced laughs doom
Indulges in delight

It's getting out of hand
The final curtain will fall

Hear my voice
There is no choice
There's no way out
You'll find out

We don't regret it
So many men have failed but now he's (gone)
Go out and get it
The madman's head it shall be thine
We don't regret it
That someone else dies hidden in (disguise)
Go out and get it
Orion's hound shines bright

Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
Around the ring
Just stop running, running
Round the ring
Don't you know that fate has been decided
By the gods
Feel the distance, distance
Out of reach

Welcome to the end
Watch your step, Cassandra, you may fall
As I've stumbled on the field
Find myself in darkest places
(Sister mine)
Find myself drifting away
(Death's a certain thing)
And the other world
The other world appears

Find myself she dies in vain

I cannot be freed, I'm falling down
As time runs faster, moves towards disaster
The ferryman will wait for you, my dear

And then there was silence
Just a voice from the other world
Like a leaf in an icy world
Memories will fade

Misty tales and Poems lost
All the bliss and beauty
Will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease

In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright

The newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
The newborn's death would be a blessing to us all

Good choice?
Bad choice?
Out of three you've chosen misery

Power and wisdom you deny
(Bad choice, bad choice)

War is the only answer when Love will conquer fear

So the judgement's been made
To the fairest the graceful says
Badly he fails

(Warning)
Fear the heat of passion, father king
(Don't let him in
Don't let her in)
Desire, lust, obsession
Death they'll bring
(We can't get out
Once they are in)

She's like the sunrise
Outshines the Moon at night
Precious like starlight
She will bring in a murderous price

(In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat)
Jealousy
(I can clearly see the end now)
I can clearly see the end now
I can clearly see the end now

(The thread of life is spun)
The coin's been placed below my tongue

Never give up
Never give in
Be on our side so we can win
Never give up
Never give in
Be on out side
(Old moon's time) is soon to come

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose like one we'll stand
We'll face the storm
Created by a man

Roar Roar Roar Roar
Troy (Troy Troy Troy)
And as the lion slaughters man
I am the wolf and you're the lamb

(Hallowed) Troy will fall round the walls
Faith is shattered, bodies fall

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose like one we'll stand
It's all for one and one for all
We live for will be wiped out

I feel that something's (wrong)
Surprise, surprise they're gone

Full moon your time goes by
And new moon's still kept out of sight
We live
Misty tales and Poems lost
(We die)
All the bliss and beauty will be gone

Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease

In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright

Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
(Roam in darkness)
(We will be lost if you truly believe)
(Roam in darkness)
Troy in darkness
(There's a cold emptiness in our hearts)
That they've gone away
(And) won't come back

They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie
Lie, lie

With blossoms they'll welcome the old foe

The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite the end is near
You better be prepared

The nightmare shall be over now, there's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing and dance with us now
The nightmare shall be over now, there's nothing more to fear
The war it is over forevermore

No hope
The blind leads the blind
Carry on
Though future's denied

Mare or stallion
There's far more inside
We are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die

Misty tales and Poems lost
All the bliss and beauty
Will be gone
(Will) my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease

In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright

Holy light shines on

So the judgement's been made
We're condemned though the trial's far ahead

The crack of doom, Father
Your handsome son is heading home

Still the wind blows, calm and silent
Carries news from a distant shore
Still the wind blows, calm and silent
Carries news from a distant shore
Still the wind blows, calm and silent
(Out of mind)
Carries news from a distant shore
(Can't get it)
(Still the wind blows, calm and silent)
(Out of mind)
(Carries news from a distant shore)
(Can't get it out of my head)
(Can't get it)
(Out of mind)
(Can't get it out of my head)

Sorrow and defeat
Sorrow and defeat
