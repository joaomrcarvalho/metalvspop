Cut off the light, take a look
There's nothing beyond but pain
Suffer in the deepest void
The flame of hope is gone
What have I done?
Denied the father and the son
For a moment it seemed
There's space beyond the spheres

Aflame the night
So clear and bright
Unstable light
(You've been sacrificed in fear)
Now there's one thing for sure
I'm not afraid anymore

Day after day we've been fixed in this bowl for so long
For ages we're captured in shells and crystallized walls

Predestined or punished? By Man or God?

I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
I cannot, I will not
The age of false innocence
(Take it away from me)

(And) for a while astronomy has moved the Earth
And we've turned around the Sun
(Sanctum Officium)
Has made me believe
Has made me believe
Has made me believe

"We know for sure you're lying
Would you like to mess with holy science
You know the fear of dying
Would it be worth it to hear you crying"
I've slaughtered truth and I've shattered my heart

Far too long I have played with hellfire
And science has turned into madness
But I should have taken it higher
So I feel, so I feel
Like Judas must have felt before
That Wednesday night near by the tree

I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
I cannot, I will not
The age of false innocence
(Take It away from me)

Day after day we will gratefully suffer for more
Predestined's our part so we bleed in the name of God

Don't believe in their eternity
We're still held in blindness
And I've been turned into a liar
If there is no heaven there won't be release

I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
(I cannot) I will not
The age of false innocence
(I cannot) I will not
Deny It's false innocence
(I cannot) I will not
The age of false innocence
(Take It away from me)
