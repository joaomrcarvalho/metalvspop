Get him off the throne
Moreover he's not in control no longer
The King will come, it's over
The game goes on

Someone's waiting on the other side
Trying to get over

Got to be in this hour

There on the other side
We know that someone keeps waiting

Don't you know your enemy?
Don't you know you're damned?

Release the beast
Set it free
I've come to tell you once more
Don't let him break this seal
But let me tell you once more
Peace shall come

We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

For all must burn down in the end

We must serve the fire
We must serve the fire

Give us shelter from the storm
Give us hope
Give us shelter from the storm
Give us hope

Curse the wind
A storm from the north
Comes to divide us
Will deny us
To break your king

These were dark lands
In a dead world
Rearranged
We brought it into light
A union of the land and king

It's a new world
It is new land
But it ends here
In the here and now
Another failure once again

We will not believe in any word you may say
We will not believe in any word you may say

Now we can see the enemy
I've come to tell you once more
It's me, I hold the key
But let me tell you once more
Peace shall come

We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

For all must burn down in the end

We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire

Curse them all
They'll tear down the wall
Come to divide us
They'll defy us
Take me throne

All I am is nothing else
What you have made me
Nothing more I am
Your vision of another god
All I know is they won't give
But they will take
Your sacred light away
And still they come to praise the damned

Can't you see?
It's your innocence they'll steal away
Yes, they're coming for you
They've come to deceive
You are betrayed
You admire these liars
They'll never fool me

We will not surrender
We won't take it no more
We will not surrender
We won't take it anymore

We'll break the seal and set 'em free
I've come to tell you once more
As I will now reveal
But let me tell you once more
Peace is gone

We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

For all must burn down in the end

We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire

Determination
Blame the light
Blame the night
Day and night
Black and white

Take a look at yourself
There is nothing to fear no more
There is nothing to fear no more
