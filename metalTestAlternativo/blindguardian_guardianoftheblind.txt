Extermination thunder the strange one is back again
Lost by our only power it's aura will grind us out forever
Fall into a dark dream that we got once
the part it's real you won't believe
We're watching our own agony many years ago
Seven little children stand against the ghost
Believing is the answer but you've lost before
Find back to your infancy it's time to die
I've been the herdsman you've been my sheep
I find taste on lampskin everything's allright
killing for the thirst for small children sweat
I give them illusions to raise their fear
Hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears
Feel the sweetness of it's death everything's allright
But there's a new feeling I've never known
There must be a third one a mighty guardian

[Ref.:]
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of heaven
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of the child

[Solo]

Dark is it's world. and lonely we're reaching it again
Fear our returning visions to madness we'll fall
if we can't kill the beast forever we must die now
One has blown his life away
Once we were a circle fighting hand in hand
Our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain
By the sweet taste of our live it call us back again
We'll find the answer it's time to die
By a ritual we've hurt it but we've not kill
little Billy you must find your way
Believe in you we ask for but where
we can never find
there must be a sign for the
Guardian of the Blind

[Ref.:]
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of heaven
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse
Come to it's world following the sign
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Give us the help we're waiting for your sign
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
