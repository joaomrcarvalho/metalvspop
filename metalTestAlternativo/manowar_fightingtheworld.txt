Fight fight fight
Fighting the world every single day
Fighting the world for the right to play
Heavy Metal in my brain
I'm fighting for Metal 'cause it's here to stay

Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been fighting the World
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been fighting
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight

Now people keep asking if we're going to change
I look'em in the eye
Tell'em no way
Stripes on a tiger don't wash away
Manowar's made of steel not clay

Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been fighting the World
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been fighting
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight

See my brother standing by my side
Only got one thing on ever mind
Radio's playing this nation wide
Turn it up louder till we all get fright

Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been fighting the World
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been fighting
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight
Fight - Fighting the World
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
