Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching "Billy Graham" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
