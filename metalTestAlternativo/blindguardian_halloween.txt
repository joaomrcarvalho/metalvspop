Years ago I came back.
This'll be my hardest attack.
Burning fire in my brain.
I can feel the deadly flame.

You'll never make it, your blood I suck.
Your fire's burning round my neck.
Celebration, let the day.

Hunting me down, there's no escape.
There's no way out, but trying to escape.
You're just insane, can't catch me.

Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.
Halloween, can feel the Kiss of Death on Halloween.

When you feel the Kiss of Death,
there's nothing you can do.
An angel sent me to destroy and kill.
Yeah.

You see the X, but it's too late.
It's in your head and you are dead.
There's no way out, they tell us.

Can feel the Kiss of Death.
There's nothing in my head but blood.

Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.
Halloween, can feel the Kiss of Death on Halloween.

This gaining dawn I feel.
Just tell me how this is real.
Is it the end of me and you?
Can feel the Kiss of Death.
There's nothing in my head but blood.

Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.
Halloween, can feel the Kiss of Death on Halloween.
Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.
