Voices of Victory
All Shout and proclaim
The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Raise of the will our  prophecy filled

I'm the lord of the day and the night
Ive nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late

[Chorus:]
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings

My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They Pray I will never appear
The Life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear

I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

[Chorus:]
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings

All the days of his live
He walked without fear
All who's lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So true is justice and retribution were un failling

As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings..

I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

[Chorus x3]

King of kings!!!
King of kings!!!

King of...

Of Kings!
