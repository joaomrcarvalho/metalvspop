He is descended from giants. His father Loki,
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla!

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day

One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led

Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of across the sky
To the world of gods and men

Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high

Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
