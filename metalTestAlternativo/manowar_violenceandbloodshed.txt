Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walkin' the streets
Scums have their day
'Til they run into me

Are you ready?

Livin' in fear ain't livin to me
I'm armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in 'Nam
Shot up my friends
I'm back in the street
The fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But I'll die like a man

Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed

Now that we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch
I'm paying all
All my life I been waitin' to see
Who's gonna win, crumbs or me

Are you ready?

My brother's still in Da-Nang
Puttin' an ad in the back of Kerrang
I'm lookin' for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back to 'Nam 'cause no one else win

Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays

Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
