[Dead girl:]
Please, sister, wake me up
you've traveled far
Release my mind
Sing this song of mine
Save me from drowning
Quick, cast your spell on me
I sense you're finally getting near
Can you hear me crying?
I've got to break the silence

[The lover:]
I know they're out there
Play hide and seek
watching
My love is wasted

[The storyteller:]
My worst dreams
I can't leave them
I'm the black queen
Here in barren lands

[The fox:]
When you walk down
You may not find relief
will you go down there
I wonder
Wonder why

[All:]
Here on this road of no release
Pale reign of misery
That even time cannot erase
On through my sorrows
Life will go on

[Dead girl:]
Words and dreams unite
I hear an ancient voice
It's calling for me
When death and life collide
I hear an ancient song

[The resurrected girl:]
Deep inside
I can't find myself
Can't remember at all
The past and my strange end
come guide me now
Can't remember my fall
There's something
There's someone
It's ain't over now
The void - There's more to it
It's real and still alive

[The necromancer:]
I will find you
Slipping away
I'll bind you
Still I conquer the world
Take him away

[All:]
Here on this road of no release
Pale reign of misery
That even time cannot erase
On through my sorrows
Life will go on

[The fox:]
My last steps
Can't leave her
I, the old fox
Will take revenge

[Old man:]
I cannot heal your fear and doubts
The void, It waits for us
Still, After all the ghosts are howling
You cannot run, you cannot hide
The void, it waits for us
Still after all there is no choice

[All:]
Here on this road of no release
Pale reign of misery
That even time cannot erase
On through my sorrows
Life will go on

[The girl:]
Find me, I'm drowning
Then once again
There's nothing left I fear
There's nothing more to say
And no more games to play
to play
