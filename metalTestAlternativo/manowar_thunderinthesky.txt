If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever born from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain that learns me

When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die

I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast

Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me

When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die

How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the thunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder
