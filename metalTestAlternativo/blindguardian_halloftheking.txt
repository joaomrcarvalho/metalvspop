Alone I walk, hearing a voice,
That's calling my name
No one with you, God, why I didn't care
On through death take me away
To the place time will not fade
Colder than dead, Darkness - eternity,
But look out

A hundred thousand centuries
The sun had never seen
So near but much too far
Eternal place you know what's life
But cannot tell

I can never see you changing
But you look to me
Time will never heal your wounds
But you're immortal

Hall of the King a vision of the end
Hall of the King don't cry for us
Don't hear us calling
Oh watch out for me
Hall of the light
My last sin

You find yourself, just take a look
To see you must open your eyes
Like a hawk in the sky, a wonder that dies
Don't ask me why

You're the birth and you're the end
You've been hurt but you're not dead
Discovering you is what should never be
Poisoned are our souls,
And dark our hearts
Ruins we have left to rule the world
Destructive are our minds,
It's much too late
