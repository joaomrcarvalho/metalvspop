It cannot be seen but there's blood on the green
Only God knows I'm innocent
Take me, take me home
A dark seed reigns in me like the Storm rules over the sea
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone

Don't dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by

They're getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away

I will not move, yet
I'll stand still instead

There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends

War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore

The field's been left in sorrow
The father and the son they're gone
The Sun shines bright and anger rises
Lorn and lonely torn apart
Don't you think it's time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss

Let's pray that heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror shall honour arise
So let's pray and blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright

Don't you hear me crying, crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name

There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends

War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore

That's what the minstrel sing
Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
Renowned be the lion-hearted

Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground

Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger

Fiercely intense outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord

War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
