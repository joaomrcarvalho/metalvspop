Don't talk to strangers
'cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven 'cause it's really only hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'cause they'll only bring you down

Hey you, you know me
You've touched me, but I'm real
I'm forever the one who lets you look and see
Can You feel me? I'm danger - I'm a stranger
And I
I'm darkness, I'm anger, I'm pain
I am the master
The evil song you sing inside your brain, drive you insane
Don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind yeah
Run away, run away go
Don't let them in your mind, touch your soul

Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'cause the words may come out real

Don't talk to strangers
'cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'cause they'll only bring you down

Run away
