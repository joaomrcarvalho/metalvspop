Sammy was low,
Just watching the show,
Over and over again.
He knew it was time,
He'd made up his mind,
To leave his dead life behind.

His boss said to him
Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions
Right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should have been sweeping,
At the emerald bar.

Spread your wings and fly away,
Fly away, far away.
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away.
Pull yourself together,
'cause you know you should do better,
That's because you're a free man.

He spends his evenings alone,
In his hotelroom.
Keeping his thoughts to himself,
He'd be leaving soon.
Wishing he was miles and miles away,
Nothing in this world, nothing,
Would make him stay.

Since he was small,
Had no luck at all,
Nothing came easy to him.
Now it was time,
He'd made up his mind,
This could be my last change

His boss said to him
Now listen boy, you're always dreaming,
You got no real ambition,
You won't get worried for.
Sammy, boy don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy,
At the emerald bar?

(So honey) spread you wings and fly away,
Fly away, far away.
Spread your little wings and fly away,
Fly away, far away.
Pull yourself together,
'cause you know you should do better,
That's because your a free man.
Come on honey (fly with me)...
