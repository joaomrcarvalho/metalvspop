I arrive a stranger in this land and
Those who seek me their Blood will wash the land
They who need me now reach out their hand
And If she heals me will I be God or Man

Tell Me
Will I live or Die
Then tell me Why
Tell me who I am
God or Man

Step Aside
Where I ride
Or you will die

My protection I give to those in need
Mother, Son and Daughter and Father will be free
from the chains of death upon them
I shall end their misery
With Blood upon my Hammer
Now the wolves of men shall bleed

Tell Me
Will I live or Die
Then tell me Why
Now tell me who I am
God or Man

Step Aside
Where I ride
Or you will die

I'm Alive
And I know Why
Cause of Lies
For you will die

You'll know the curse of my pain
Thunder and Rain

My protection I give to those in need
Mother, Son and Daughter and Father will be free
From the chains of death upon them
I shall end their misery
With Blood upon my Hammer
Now the wolves of men shall bleed

Step Aside
Where I ride
Step Aside
Or you will die

I'm Alive
And I know Why
Cause of Lies
You will die
