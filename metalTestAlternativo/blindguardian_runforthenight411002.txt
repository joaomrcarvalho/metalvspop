There comes the last part and end of our old age
with thunder and lightning the dark lord is taking
the crown of the whole world
his creatures will kill me and poisons my soul
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are meaningless - Oh no
I see the hill byt it's so far away
I know I can't reach it
but I try again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now

[Ref:]
Run for the night burn away
the times of his fall I've to pay
Visions of darkness prepared for the last strike
and bloodlust their weapons and madness
you see to their
eyes there's no way out
I'm lost in a dark dream and losing control
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless - Oh no
I see the hill but it's so far away I know I can't
reach it
but try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will
how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now

[Ref:]
Run...
You see them running in the shadows of the night
it is not what it used to be
they've been scared and they've been anxiously tonight
you see them running with the wind they
run for the night [3x]
