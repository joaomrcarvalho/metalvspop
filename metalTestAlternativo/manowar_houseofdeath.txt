Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget

[Chorus:]
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell

Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night

[Repeat chorus]

Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die

Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell
