The son of giants
Walks across the sky
To the gods a friend
Fathered beast and men

As a falcon he did fly
Far across the sky
To take back the hammer
Of Thor his friend

He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men

He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he

To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky

He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men

He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

Brother to Thor
And Odin god of war
Loki god of fire
Reigns for evermore

The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he

To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
God of fire

Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
