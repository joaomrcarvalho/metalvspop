And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
By the call of the moon
Was it really me
I saw in the mirror screaming
I swallowed hate and lies
Through a thousand cries
Someone's sucking out my energy

What can I do
On this road to nowhere

Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time

And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
Into insanity's claws

Come with me and join me
A new life's waiting for you
Jump through the mirror
Leave fear behind
No matter where I tried
The candle light seemed
Lost forever
Before my vision fades
-cathedral
-falling tears

We're not alone
There's someone else, too
From the mirror's other side
Reflecting the cruel part of your soul
It's time for your choice

What can I do
On this road to nowhere

Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time

And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
By the call of the moon

[SOLO]

Heart of dragon lies

What can I do
On this road to nowhere

Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time

And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
Into sanity's claws

I'm not a king
I'm just a bard
How can I trust
If there is good and bad
The wounds of life
They will remain
At least I found a friend
