Father obented me
I ask thee
raise thy hand
we! the sons of Odin!
await thy command
Born!
under the sign
of the hammer we stand
and here we all may die!
our blood on the ground
the battle horns sound!
Let thy Valkyries fly!!

[Chorus:]
Down from the sky into the fight
Clutched full of rage!!
full of thunder
and glory
Swords in the wind
crossing the sky
Lords of doom bring an end to their story

Today is the day we Die in the fight
None shall remain..
till last one for night
now Valhalla's calling us immortal
we are gods immortal!
We are Gods Of War!!

Odin
hear the fallen wait
To join thee
by thy side
let Valhalla's gates
Open wide.....

Born! under the sign of the hammer
They lived
and here they fought and died!
There blood on the ground..
The battle horns sound!!

Let thy Valkyries fly!!!

[Chorus:]
Down from the sky into the fight
Clutched full of rage!!
full of thunder
and glory
Swords in the wind
crossing the sky
Lords of doom bring an end to their story

Today is the day we Die in the fight
None shall remain..
till last one for night
now Valhalla's calling us immortal
we are gods immortal!
We are Gods Of War!!

[Chorus]

Woooooa!
Wooooooa!
Woooooooa!
Wooooooooa!
Woooooooooa!
Woaaaa!
Wooooa!!!!
