From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear

For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine

All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say "I believe"

[Verse 1,2,3]

Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say "I believe"
If you want to win tonight, say "I believe"
