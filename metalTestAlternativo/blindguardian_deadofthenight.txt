Every night I hear thunder.
The shadow, can't you see?
So one night I will follow.
The dark side reigns in me.

(He) leads me to the dark plains.
The end is near, I feel.
But (I've) never seen his damned face.
My hearts pound hard in fear.

Dead of the night, take me away.
Dead of the night, he's looking for you.

A hundred solemn faces,
they look at me and laugh.
But if one wants to touch them,
they glow through nothingness.

If I come to tell you,
you look at me and laugh.
I never found the doctor,
so one day I'll be mad.

In that night I follow.
No pain, no work, no more.
He leads me on through the dark realm.
My sense grows far too dense.

Dead of the night, take me away.
Dead of the night, he's looking for you.

They will not take me easy.
No love will come through death.
I take them on and kill myself.
And just feel emptiness.

Now you see them rising,
but no one knows but me.
So, don't try (to) follow a demon
and wait for a last attack.

In that night I follow.
No pain, no work, no more.
He leads me on through the dark realm.
My sense grows far too dense.

Dead of the night, take me away.
Dead of the night, he's looking for you.
Dead of the night.
