[Hansi:]
In the dark night (they) defend their missiles,
where it's the night we all die.
Enthralling power, who searches to be masters.
They play their game with your life.
The burning fire comes around, the heat is on
Just for this day, it's all sad blues.

[Marcus:]
The East Sun is burning hard.
See, your life is short.
See the rainbow in the mirror.
See the rainbow in the sky.
See the desert in front of you.
See the desert of life.

Standing in the cold rain, waiting for the end.
See the shadows of the night.
I have told you, but now it is too late.
These are Symphonies of Doom.

[Hansi:]
Feel the danger, this final battle.
It will imply us all God's agony.
The endless blitzes just blind your eyes shut
And blow your life out to nothingness.
Black shadows storming in the East, but you can't see.
The liec has set that power free.

[Marcus:]
The East Sun is burning hard.
See, the life is short.
See the rainbow in the mirror.
See the rainbow in the sky.
See the desert in front of you.
See the desert of life.

I'm no sinner. I'm no fool.
I have heard these chants before.
I have told you, but now it is too late.
These are Symphonies of Doom.
