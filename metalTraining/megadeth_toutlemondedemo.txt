[Music & Lyrics - Mustaine / Friedman / Ellefson / Menza]

Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The more harder the rules became

I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I had accomplished
All my plans denied

So as you read this know my friends

I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think about me
My body's gone that's all

À tout le monde, À tous mes amis
Je vous aime, Je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say

Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
The sleeping feel no more pain
And the living all are scarred

So as you read this know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think about me
My body's gone that's all

À tout le monde, À tous mes amis
Je vous aime, Je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

[Solo - Friedman]

So as you read, know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think about me
My body's gone that's all

À tout le monde, À tous mes amis
Je vous aime, Je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
