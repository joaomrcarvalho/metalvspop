I feel so lost for me inside,
Lost am I, will it never end,
But never am I stained black
Now the end is drawing near,
My hate is growing, can't you hear,
It burns me with my cruelty

(And I'm off!)

Like the fire of pain in the daylight
Full of hate, your hatred gets up doom

[Chorus:]
Pain... I can't control it anymore,
You'll see the red light more and more
Trapping you in destroying despite
By the red light in my eyes

So, better wake up, drink your blood,
Follow me and be a god
Can't you fucking look into my eyes,
Watch this god arise, yeah

(Come on!)

I feel the last one in this time,
Lost am I, will it never end
But never am I stained black, jet black
Now walk away and flee into Hell,
Take away and bleed my heart
I do my blood-red sigh

I can feel your hate of death,
I'm running on this darkened little path
Take your time, beat me down, sometime, to die (die!)

[Chorus:]
Pain... I can't control it anymore,
See the red light more and more
Trapping you in destroying despite
By the red light in my eyes

Doesn't matter what is on the top, right, way too down below,
That's how the werewolf burns in me
Oh God, I see the light again,
I'm gonna be getting someone in my grave

[Chorus:]
Pain... I can't control it anymore,
See the red light more and more
Trapping you in destroying despite
By the red light in my eyes
