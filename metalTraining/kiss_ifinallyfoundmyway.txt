So many people tried to help me on my way
So little time and there's still so much left to say
There's no explaining all the things that I've been through
But I've finally fount my way to you
I finally found my way to you

Now the day is endhing and the night begins to fall
Sometimes I wonder if I'll make it back at all
I gave up everything I had and ever knew
But I finally found my way
Finally found my way
I finally found my way to you

Remember how we used to hide away
We'd share the secrets of our souls
Turn down the lights and dance the night away
We'd dance the night away
We'd dance the night away

Remember how we used to hide away
We'd dance the night away [x4]

And now I'll hold you like I never have before
I'll let you go just long enough to lock that door
The words I whisper come so late and overdue
But I finally found my way, I finally found my way
I finally found my way to you

To you baby.
