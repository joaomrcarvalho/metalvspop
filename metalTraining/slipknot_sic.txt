Pain!

Here comes the pain

Enemy,
Show me what you wanna be
I can handle anything
Even if I can't handle you

Readily
Either way it better be
Don't you fuckin' pity me
Get up, get off...

What the hell am I sayin'?
I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent
I want somebody to step up, step off

Walls!
Let me fall! Fuck you all!
Get a grip, don't let me slip
'til I drop the ball

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're goin' down, this is a war!

Fuck it!

Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind?
You're leavin' me suspect, I'm leavin' you grotesque
Feels like a burn from which you never learn
Cause and effect, you jealous ass
Press your face against the glass - suffer

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're goin' down, this is a war!

Go!

[4x]
I've just begun
It's about that time
Gotta get mine

[4x]
You can't kill me
'Cause I'm already inside you

Sic [4x]
