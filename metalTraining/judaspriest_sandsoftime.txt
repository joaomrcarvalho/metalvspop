The winds of change are everywhere
And all the world must be aware
There's nowhere left for man to go
The sands of time are running low

These vision fall before my face
I see the end of human's race
These feelings rise inside my soul
And everything is out of control

The winds of change
Are in the air
The winds of change
Are everywhere
