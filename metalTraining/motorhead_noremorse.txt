All men know what waits for us
Wooden box, worm and dust
Maybe heaven, pearly gates
Hasty prayer, when it's too late
Burn in hell, all is lost,
Purgatory, fingers crossed
Which or Who, your or mine?
Eternity's a long, long time.

Never mind, never fail
Right this time, on the nail
Never mind, Never mind, Never mind, Never mind
No remorse, No remorse, No remorse, No remorse

You know it well, confess it now,
Christian guilt, is what's allowed,
Other words are heresy
Burn forever 1, 2, 3
What can you do? No guaranties,
Hopeful begging, on your knees,
All in all, you're going down.
Winged sinner or singed clown

[Chorus]

Repent ye fool, God will hear,
Christmas carol, midnight clear
Otherwise, pits of fire
Punishment for base desire,
Satan waits, goatee beard,
Long old tail, nasty spear,
If you believe these tales they tell
Then you deserve to burn in Hell.

[Chorus]
