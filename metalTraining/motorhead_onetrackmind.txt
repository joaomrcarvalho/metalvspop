One arm bandit, one way ride
One arm bandit, one more try
One way ticket, one horse town
One way ticket, no way down

[CHORUS]
One track mind, one track mind
One track mind, one track mind

Two lane highway, two hand car
Two lane highway, too damned far
Two faced women, two time guys
Two faced women, two black eyes

[CHORUS]

Three time loser, break the law
Three time loser, two bit whore
Three ring circus, free form show
Three ring circus, way to go

[CHORUS]
