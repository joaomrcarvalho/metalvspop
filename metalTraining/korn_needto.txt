I, I am confused, fighting myself
Wanting to give in, needing your help
Skin cold with fear, feel it when we touch
Outside I don't know you, but inside I'm fucked

Can you see it in me?
Skin cold from touch
Each day confronted with what I have done
You pull me closer, I push you away
You tell me it's OK, I can't help but feel the pain

I hate you!
Why are you taken?
I love you!
I feel so helpless
Why is it you?
Ripping my insides each time I'm with you
Why do I cry?
Why do I really need to?
Why! Why! Why! Why!
Fuck you, bitch!
Need to [x3]... fuck [x4]...

I hate you!
Why are you taken?
I love you!
I feel so helpless
Why is it you?
Ripping my insides each time I'm with you
Why do I try?
Why do I fucking need to?
Fuck [x6]
Slut
