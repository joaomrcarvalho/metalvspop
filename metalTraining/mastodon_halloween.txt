Orange and black take me back to Halloween
I've given to the blind as you can see
gasoline runs thru my veins
so don't you mess with me
I couldn't tame that beast with a handful of meat

Just wait till my robe falls at my feet
cold and dilated like my memories
strange voices in my head
who could they be
it's the master of disguise and he's breaking me

You will find spirits never rise
without warning
feel your fate as you come alive
they're here to take you home

Crashing through the walls
you're the one I want to see
bent all up on a moon-soaked night
death is riding with me

Dripping blood with hell froze at my feet
use a razor blade to cut some lines
Because now I'm going to speed

You will find spirits never rise
without warning
feel your fate as you come alive
they're here to take you
