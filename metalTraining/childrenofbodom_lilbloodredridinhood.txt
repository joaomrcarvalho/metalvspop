Hua!

Fire of the light thy holy angel.
Light before the night, dark you'd try.
You try reversing the ray of fire.
My enemy sets our desire.

I'll kill you!

Set aside the call of silence,
In the race of so long!
Take me down, and I can feel you,
My lil' bloodred ridin' hood!

Ugh!

Ooow!!!

C'mon motherfuckers!

Little blood so far away.
For a second did I go.
It's a loss!
But I'll follow you 'til the end of the world.
I killed it for you.
I hate you and I want it!

[Solo]

I'll kill you!

Oh, yayaow!

Set aside the call of silence,
In the race of so long.
Take me down, oh please, can I feel you?
My lil' bloodred ridin' hood.
