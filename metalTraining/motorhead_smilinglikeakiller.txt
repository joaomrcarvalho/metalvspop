I'm the one you never see, in the dead of night,
Peeking in your window, staying out of sight,
GO to bed, lock the door, don't look in the mirror,
What if I was right behind you,
Smiling Like A Killer,

I'm the knocking at your door, when you're all alone,
I'm the scratching zombie claw, in your twilight zone,
Cut your throat, catch your breath, blood run like a river,
Last thing you see before your death,
Smiling Like A Killer,

Killers in the house,
Killers in the yard,
Smile, smile, smile,
Killers they're so hard,
Smiling at your kids,
Smiling at your mom,
Smiling at your pets,
They know where you come from,
They know where you come from,

I'm the razor at your throat, in your fever dreams,
I'm the one to get your goat, nothing's what it seems,
Freeze your smile, stop your heart, creep and crawl and slither,
Come to you and make your mark,
Smiling Like A Killer,

Killers in your room,
Squirming in your chair,
Smile, smile, smile,
Killers they're not fair,

Smiling in the crowd,
Smiling all alone,
Smiling in your ear,
Call you on the phone,
Call you on the phone,

I'm the creepy homeless guy, hanging around your school,
I'm the one to make you gone, low and base and cruel,
In the evening we can dance, piggy in the middle,
I will show you true romance,
Smiling Like A Killer,

Killers in the mist,
Killers in the fog,
Smile, smile, smile,
They might eat your dog,
Smiling here and now,
Smiling all the time,
Smiling in your dreams,
A Smile just like mine,
A Smile just like mine,
A Smile just like mine
