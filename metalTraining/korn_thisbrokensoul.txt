This Broken Soul

I, I can't remember the day, when I lie and cried
I miss the time, the day, though I try,
to hide it from you, this broken soul, I can't deny, arms growin cold
Nowhere to run, no one to hold me

This Broken Soul

I still remember the way,
how you smiled as I cried, you laughed,
I bled everyday, I could never get away from you
This broken soul, I can't deny, arms growin so cold,
nowhere to run, no one to hold me

This Broken Soul

No one to hold me

I can't remember when,
you and I we walk as friends
never seen, a foolish idea
How can these lies be a good bye now
I, I will find,
you in my way,
a different pain,
took inside of me,
I will find [x4]
you in my way, a different pain
took the pride of me, one I'll never hold,
