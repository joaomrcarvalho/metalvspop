Street hustler comes up to me one day
And I'm walkin' down the street, mindin' my own business
Now he looks me up and he looks me down and says
"Hey man, what be this" and "What be that"
and "Why you gotta look like that?"
Well I just looked at him, I kinda laughed, I said
Hey man, I am cool, I am the Breeze

Haven't you heard, there's a new revolution
Gotta spread the word - too much confusion
All hell's breakin' loose -
hey hey have you read the news
All hell's breakin' loose -
overloadin' 'n' blowin' my fuse
All hell's breakin' loose -
day and night, baby, night and day
All hell's breakin' loose -
in the streets there's a brand new way, yeah

You know we ain't always winners,
but this is the life we choose
And we won't change or rearrange,
and we ain't never ever gonna lose
It ain't always easy when the goin' gets rough
When you're gettin' even,
you gotta show your stuff - tell about it now

Take a look around, only one solution
Set the world on fire, fight the institution
Gonna stand our ground, feel the new sensation
Something's goin' down - rock the nation
All hell's breakin' loose -
hey hey, have you read the news
All hell's breakin' loose -
overloadin' 'n' blowin' my fuse
All hell's breakin' loose -
day and night, baby, night and day
All hell's breakin' loose -
ah, take it

Haven't you heard, only one solution
Gotta spread the word -
you gotta tell it to the people now
Take a look around, feel the new sensation
Set the world on fire - rock the nation

All hell's breakin' loose, all hell's breakin' loose
All hell's breakin' loose -
baby baby baby baby whoo
All hell's breakin' loose -
hey, hey, have you read the news
All hell's breakin' loose -
overloadin' 'n blowin' my fuse
All hell's breakin' loose -
day and night, baby, night and day
All hell's breakin' loose -
in the streets you can hear them say
