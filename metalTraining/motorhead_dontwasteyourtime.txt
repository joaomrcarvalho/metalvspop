Bet you're scared of dying, scared of death,
Think you might choke on your final breath,
Wanna go to Heaven, scared of Hell
Scared of the Devil and his tail as well,
Ain't no insurance for the final ride,
No photo finish, nobody to bribe,
Baby, I know only you can live your life,
And there is only you can do it right.

Don't waste your time, Don't waste your time,
Don't waste a minute listen here,
Don't waste your time, Don't waste your time,
Everybody going, standing in the line,
Don't you worry, Baby, worse things than death around here.

Don't chase after money, you are gonna lose your soul,
Same for religion, out of control,
Don't fall for money, or heroine again,
Needles for your enemies, bullshit for your friends,
The way we're going, same as we came,
Bought the fucking picture and we're playing for the frame.
Everybody asking you when they gonna die,
I think that they should be askin' why.

Don't waste your time, Don't waste your time,
Don't waste an hour of your life,
Don't waste your time, Don't waste your time,

The ghost walk beside us, been there all the time,
You damn well there is worse things than death to fear.

Don't waste your time, Don't waste your time,
Don't be staring at the wall,
Don't waste your time, Don't waste your time,
You better find a reason why you should be alive.
If you're just a taker, then you might as well check out, that's all.
