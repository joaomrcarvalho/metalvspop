I've been choking on the air that you've been giving me
it's all a game to you, to me it's an atrocity
as you add another loop onto my noose
i lose all sense of what is abuse

'cause it's always been a bone of contention
this game of "what it is that I've done for you"
I've given you everything for nothing in return
and I'm so tired of bleeding for the respect that I've earned

because no, nobody knows, nobody knows
because nobody knows anything

I don't know how much generosity that I can take
until I leave a trail of bodies lying in my wake
how many times do I lose my mind 'til I realize
give me the high hat and you think that i should compromise?
