Were you ever lost,
were you ever young,
were you ever safe little brother,
Do you see the sense of the evidence,
are you still part of the struggle,
Did you bang your head,
did you go to bed,
does it still feel pretty funky,
Lay back and dream,
in the death machine,
pity you still think like a monkey,

Bring it up, bring it down til you hit the ground,
Get a rude attitude, turn the world around,
Shall we see, shall we disagree,
Sing it all In The Name of Tragedy,

Did you ever lie,
ever wonder why,
nobody believed you honey,
What a pretty smile,
drive the people wild,
wonder who ran off with the money,
Do you ever change,
is it going to rain,
will it bring you pennies from heaven,
Do you know the score,
are you waiting for,
anxious for the new Armageddon,

Live it up, live it down til we hit the ground,
Cop a rude attitude from the world around,
Shall we see, shall we disagree,
Sing it all In The Name of Tragedy,

Marbles in your mouth,
what's it all about,
do you know the name of the winner,
If I was to go,
would you let it show,
life is not a TV dinner,
If you dream of me,
will you ever see,
do you want a piece of the action,
If I wasn't sure,
would you do it more,
help me to achieve an erection,

Get it up, get it down til you hit the ground,
Get a rude attitude, turn the world around,
Shall we see, shall we disagree,
All In The Name of Tragedy,

Sing it loud, sing it out, make the people shout,
Get it all, get it on, get it sorted out,
Be a seer, be sincere, can you really see,
All In The Name of Tragedy
