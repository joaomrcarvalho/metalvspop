Do you want this?
Do you need this?
You know you want this
You'll feed on what we decide
You really want this
You really need this
You know you'll want to
Listen close to what's specified
Yeah, you want this
Yeah, you need this
Don't you want to be
A part of the trend this time?

So let this serve as a reminder
A warning sign
You lost control of your mind
With no one inside

Do you want this?
Do you need this?
You know you want to
Be a part of the winning side
You really want this
You really need this
I know you want to be
A part of the dignified
Damn you want this
Damn you need this
Damn you for falling
For an existence so contrived

So let this serve as a reminder
A warning sign
You lost control of your mind
With no one inside

So let this serve as a reminder
A warning sign
You lost control of your mind
With no one inside

So let this serve as a reminder
A warning sign
You lost control of your mind
With no one inside
