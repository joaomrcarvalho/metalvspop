When I see you, girl you turn my head, you make me dizzy
I get a good vibration
When I look into your big blue eyes, I start to quiver and shake
I get a strange sensation
When you walk by me you strut around, you make me crazy, I get no relaxation

Talk to me, talk to me, all I want is a little conversation
Talk to me, talk to me, all I want is a little conversation, talk to me

People tell me that you run around and that you're no good
You got a bad reputation
I don't care what all the people say, you know they talk too much
It's a fascination
All I wanna do is talk to you and maybe go out, and form some kind of relation

So talk to me, talk to me, all I want is a little conversation
Talk to me, talk to me, all I want is a little conversation
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me - why don't you
Talk to me - c'mon and talk to me

I just wanna talk to you

Girl I wish you knew the way I felt, you think I'm silly, that it's infatuation
So we better get together soon, because I need you girl
I can't stand the frustration, so

Talk to me, talk to me, all I want is a little conversation
Talk to me, talk to me, all I want is a little conversation
Talk to me, talk to me, all I want is a little conversation
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me - why don't you
Talk to me - c'mon and talk to me

Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me - I just wanna talk to you
