Back to back, you see me now
Show me what you're hiding here
I can't move if I don't sing
I can't stand I got no chair

Can't see me, I'm the man, ain't no joke
Can't see me, master plan, up in smoke
Can't hear me, I'm so loud, suits me fine
Can't hear me, I ain't proud, all the time

Follow me, and don't you move
Stop at nothing,show your teeth
I can see you I'm not deaf
Two years later, twice a week

Can't see me, I'm the man, laid in bad
Can't see me, give a damn, Motorhead
Can't hear me, up your way, ring your chimes
Can't hear me, I can't stay, all the time

I can tell you it aint me
I won't be no beast up there
Turn me  'round 'cos I can't dance
Be a spaceship, I don't care

Can't hear me, stand up straight,row my boat
Can't hear me, hit the deck, fishtail goat
Can't see me, on the game, ain't no crime
Can't see me, aeroplane, all the time
