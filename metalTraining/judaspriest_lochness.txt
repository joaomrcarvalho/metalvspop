Grey mist drifts upon the water
The mirrored surface moves
Awakened of this presence
Dispelling legends proof

A beastly head of onyx
With eyes set coals of fire
It's leathered hide
Glides glistening
Ascends the heathered briar

This legend lives
Through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternities on and on and on

Lochness confess your terror of the deep
Lochness distress
Malingers what you keep
Lochness protects monstrosity
Lochness confess to me

Somehow it heeds the piper
From battlements that call
From side to side it ponders
Impassioned in the skirl

This highland lair of mystery
Retains a lost world's empathy
Resiliant to discovery on and on and on

This legend lives
Through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternity
Your secret lies safe with me

This creatures peril from decease
Implores to mankind for release
A legacy to rest in peace and on and on and on
