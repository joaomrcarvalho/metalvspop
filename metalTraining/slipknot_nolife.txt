My freedom is best 
Whole country's on house arrest 
And everyone's a suspect 
You can't feel the flow because you died 
Face down on a "suicide" 
The muthafucker's on self-destruct 
Nobody guardin' your back, it's all a front 
Save this! My rage is bliss! 
I'm takin' names and gettin' pissed! 

Where's Chuck D when ya need him? 
You ain't shit, just a puddle on the 
Bed spread 
The maniac psycho 
Cool j screamed the shit 
But I still can't believe it 
Man, it's funny that you scare me so 
Just enough to fuck me up again and again 
Hard life is hard as hell 
Better back the fuck on up 
Cuz this is... 

No kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(I've got to get out!) 
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(You can't blame me!) 

Can't be real no more - Your mask is skin and bone 
Savor every flavor you want cuz it's not your own 
Bad-ass at bat, man 
Forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win 
Breathe! Amer-cult, Breathe! On more - Seethe! 
Freak like you gotta pair 
Won't be my fault 
When you're painted in the corner of a no-good life 
This is... 

No kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(I've got to get out!) 
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(You can't blame me!) 

I can't remember, I don't understand, 
Is it malice that makes you this way? 
Carry it with you 'til someone forgives you 
I laugh cuz there's nothing to say 
You can't begin to consider the 
Palpable hate in the air when you're here 
None of us wonder what weather you're under 
You're making it perfectly clear! 

Lights ain't on - shit ain't right 
Never had peace so I had to fight 
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against 
The wall, slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me 
You're all reality and sound bites 
And the freedom is never in plain sight 
The feelings, the question, the price is too 
Human, for fucking sake - This is... 

No kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(I've got to get out!) 
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(You can't blame me!)
