[Spoken intro:]
They say drinking is a way to die,
But at the end... dying is a way to drink, that's why...

Unquenchable thirst burns you inside
The ruins of already burnt out mind
Inexhaustable craving for something
You're already crying.

[Bridge:]
Degenerate drunk with a razor blade
Strung out spilling your own blood.
Exterminate scars already made.
Ready for another drink, can you wait?

Detoxing, here come the withdrawals.
[Whispering:] Maybe you've gone too far.
Deep within things are getting hot
Can't deny, take another shot.

[Chorus:]
Blooddrunk - wasted again.
All inside your pain will fade
Blooddrunk - you call me insane.
Degenerate bloodrunk with a razor blade.

[Chorus x2]
