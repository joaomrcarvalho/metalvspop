Give me the dust of my father 
Stand on the face of the ancients
Bare the secret flesh of time itself 

Follow me (Follow me) 
I've come so far, I'm behind again 
Follow me (Follow me) 
I wish so hard I'm there again 
Follow me (Follow me) 
Follow me (Follow me) 

All that I wanted were things I had before 
All that I needed I never needed more 
All of my questions are answers to my sins 
All of my endings waiting to begin 

I know the way but I falter 
Can't be afraid of my patience 
There's a sacred place Razel keeps safe 

Follow me (Follow me) 
I've seen so much I'm blind again
Follow me (Follow me) 
I feel so bad I'm alive again 
Follow me (Follow me) 

All that I wanted were things I had before 
All that I needed I never needed more 
All of my questions are answers to my sins 
All of my endings waiting to begin
