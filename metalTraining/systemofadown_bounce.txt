Jump, Bounce, Down, Up

I went out on a date,
With a girl, a bit late,
She had so many friends,
Gliding through many hands.
I brought my pogo stick,
Just to show her a trick,
She had so many friends,
Gliding through many hands.

Jump Pogo?..
Bounce Pogo,
Down Pogo, Up Pogo

Unannounced twister games,
All players with no names,
They lined up double quick,
But just one pogo stick,
Everyone gets to play,
Runaway, expose',
It was so exotic,
But just one pogo stick.

Jump Pogo?..
Bounce Pogo,
Down Pogo, Up Pogo

Oh, I like to spread you out,
Touching whoever's behind

Jump Pogo?..
Bounce Pogo,
Down Pogo, Up Pogo
