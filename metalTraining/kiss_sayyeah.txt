[Verse]
You (you), you're living you life when you're dreaming
Late at night (at night) you're hearing my voice in your head (Yeah!)
But you (but you) can silence your own heavy breathing (Ha!)
When you try (you try), you wake up alone in your bed
It's time to see what it's all about
There's one cure and there's no way out

I don't want hear you might
There's a fire getting near, a spark's alight
If you're ready for a wild ride
Then let me hear you say...

[Chorus]
Yeah (yeah, yeah yeah)
Say yeah (yeah, yeah yeah)

[Verse]
I (I), I feel all the heat when you see me
And I know (I know) that you're feeling it too (oh yeah!)
Letting go (letting go) is something that should be so easy
Hold me close (hold me close), I know what you want when you do
Your friends are telling you you're better alone
But you'll regret it when you get back home

I don't want hear you might
There's a fire getting near, a spark's alight
If you're ready for a wild ride
Then let me hear you say...

[Chorus]

Who knows where we'll be in the morning
I know we're here tonight
Get uptight and it all gets so boring
It takes two to make it come alive
Take my hand, kiss your fears goodbye
There's something hear that we can't deny

[Guitar Solo]

t's time to see what it's all about
There's one cure and there's no way out

Well, let me hear you say it
I want to hear you say it
Then let me hear you say...

[Chorus]

Now I don't want hear you might
There's a fire getting near, a spark's alight
If you're ready for a wild ride
Let me hear you say...

Yeah (yeah, yeah yeah)
Say yeah (yeah, yeah yeah)
Say yeah (yeah, yeah yeah)
Let me hear you say yeah... (yeah, yeah yeah)
