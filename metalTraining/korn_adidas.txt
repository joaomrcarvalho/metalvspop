Honestly, somehow it always seems that I'm dreaming of
something I can never be
It doesn't bother me, 'cause I will always be that pimp I see
in all of my fantasies

I don't know your fucking name.
So what? Let's. . .

Screwin' may be the only way that I can truly be free
from my fucked up reality
so I dream and stroke it harder, 'cause its so fun to see my
face staring back at me

I don't know your fucking name.
So what? Let's fuck.

All Day I Dream About Sex
All Day I Dream About fuckin'
