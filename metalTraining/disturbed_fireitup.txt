When I need to spark a bit of inspiration
and the melody feels like it's trapped inside
all I need is a bit of illumination
so the rhythm can no longer run and hide.
When I take a puff from the leaves of the devil
and it carries me on the other side

Fire it up, I like to fire it up
and it feels so right
Fire it up, 'cause when I fire it up
I feel like serenity
I feel like serenity... is mine

When I need a little bit of relaxation
my medicine isn't too hard to find
When I'm looking for a bit rejuvenation
I only partake of the finest kind
And then the mystery begins to unravel
and it helps me break through to the other side

Fire it up, I like to fire it up
and it feels so right
Fire it up, 'cause when I fire it up
I feel like serenity
I feel like serenity... is mine

Fire it up, fire it up

Fire it up
Fire it up, I like to fire it up
and it feels so right
Fire it up, 'cause when I fire it up
I feel like serenity
I feel like serenity... is mine
