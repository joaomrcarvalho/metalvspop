Where have the apostles gone?
Joining hands with wicked ones
Revelation has come to pass
New world order will hold the mass

A book written by man
Used to control and command
All rights will be denied
Without the mark you shall die

No confession, all is known
New world order, you shall be shown

Monitoring all wages
New world order comes in stages
Your currency is obsolete
Feel the agony of defeat

Symbol of society today
A must-have or you shall pay
As humans' flesh leads the mind
Just a pawn, the last martyr dies

No confession, all is known
New world order, you shall be shown

Where have the apostles gone?
Joining hands with wicked ones
Revelation has come to pass
New world order will hold the mass
