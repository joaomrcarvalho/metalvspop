Flying circus on the road
Burn like fire, blind and cold
Stagefright, stagefright, oh baby
Not me, not me, not me
Stagefright, stagefright, oh man
Never got me
Crash and burn,
Crash and burn, drive on
Crash and burn,
Crash and burn, we're gone

Cheat the devil, live so long
Burn the mission, sing your song
Stagefright, stagefright, yo momma
Not me, not me, not me

Stagefright, stagefright, go back
That's where I wanna be

Crash and burn, crash and burn, drive on
Crash and burn, crash and burn, we're gone

Stagefright, stagefright,
Walk the line, love the shoes
Tattooed lady, needle blues
Stagefright, stagefright, oh baby
Not me, not me, not me
Stagefright, stagefright, get down
Something came over me

Crash and burn, crash and burn, drive on
Crash and burn, crash and burn, we're gone
Crash and burn, crash and burn, drive on, drive on,
Drive on, we're gone
