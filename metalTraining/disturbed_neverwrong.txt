You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong (never wrong)
You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong (never wrong)

You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong (never wrong)
You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong (never wrong)

You're "never ever wrong", always something more to say
You're never wrong, well you never mind, I'll be fine
You're never wrong and there's nothing more to say
You're never wrong, it's gonna end this time!
You're "never wrong", you can never be contained
You're never wrong and you never mind, I'll be fine
You're never wrong, don't even bother to explain
You're never wrong, you'll never win this time!

Feel the anger coming
Feel my patience running...
We'll it's plain to see that
You have lost your damn mind!

How could you let it end up this way?
Is there really nothing more you can say?
I'm not taking another fucking dose of your denial today!
I'm not wiling to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So just keep on talking to the wall because I'm walking away!

You're never ever wrong and you never will believe
That you were wrong, you'll just never mind, and be fine
You're never wrong? Are you really that deceived?
The illusion has to end this time.
Well you were wrong, I know it's difficult to see
That you were wrong, in your little mind, every time
Yeah you were wrong, and now you'd better believe
That the game is coming to an end this time.

Feel the anger coming
Feel my patience running
And it's easy to see you've made me lose my damn mind!

How could you let it end up this way?
Is there really nothing more you can say?
I'm not taking another fucking dose of your denial today!
I'm not wiling to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So just keep on talking to the wall because I'm walking away!

If you shut your mouth, then we might just make it
You want a fight? Be careful what you're wishing for
So say it again! Push it again!
And there is no coming back this time!
Shut your mouth, cause I just can't take it
I'm ready to fight, is it all that you were hoping for?
Don't say it again - Do it again!
There'll be no coming back this time!

How could you let it end up this way?
Is there really nothing more you can say?
I'm not taking another fucking dose of your denial today!
