Hiding in then the door way
and then the shadow
any place where danger
waits to kill my time
there is one who loves and waits
to seal your fate
I'm sure as you live and die
Live and die
Live and die

When you feel that something wrong
I'll shelter you and keep you warm
I'll never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and it wont be long
Time to reap what I have sewn
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy it once was me

Let me wrap my arms all around you
suffer the trespasses that you made
I will drink your pain away
forever and a day
if you just call out my name
If you just call
call my name
if you just call
Even whisper it

When you feel that something wrong
Ill shelter you and keep you warm
Ill never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and it wont be long
Time to reap what I have sewn
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy it once was me

SOLO!!!!!!!
