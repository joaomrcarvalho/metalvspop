Born on the other side
Of the track
Gotta get outta here
I won't look back

Born on the other side
Wild as a hurricane
Living in overdrive

Wheels of fire
In my soul
Wheels of fire
Wheels of fire
Let 'em roll

Too fast to give a damn
Stand my ground
No one or anything
To tie me down

Born on the other side
Wild as a hurricane
Living in overdrive

Wheels of fire
In my soul
Wheels of fire
Wheels of fire
Let 'em roll

Ride to live
Live to ride
Wheels of fire forever
