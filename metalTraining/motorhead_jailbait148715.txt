Hey baby you're a sweet young thing,
Still tied to Mommy's apron strings,
I don't even dare to ask your age,
It's enough to know you're here backstage,
You're Jailbait, and I just can't wait,
Jailbait baby come on

One look baby, all I need,
My decision made at lightning speed,
I don't even want to know your name,
It's enough to know you feel the same,
You're Jailbait, and I just can't wait,
Jailbait baby come on

Hey babe you know you look so fine,
Send shivers up and down my spine,
I don't care about our different ages,
I'm an open book with well thumbed pages,
You're Jailbait, and I just can't wait,
Jailbait baby come on
