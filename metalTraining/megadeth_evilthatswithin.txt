There once was a familiar face
Battle scars in disarray
A simple man, power drunk
No worries of living, no more anything

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Bastards possesses to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the evil that's within?

Pyramids of dead men and dogs
Spoils of war so they say
Once burned, forever marked
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Bastards possesses to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the evil that's within?

[Solo - Marty]

Pressure coming down
Down on me, gonna break
Broken fingernails
Digging in, scratch your face

Nervous, like a cat
Gonna jump through my skin
Shadows on the wall
Stretching out, grope for me

Evil, evil
Evil, deep in me
Evil, let me be
Evil, let me bleed
Evil, set me free
Evil, set me free
Evil, set me free
Evil, the evil that's within
