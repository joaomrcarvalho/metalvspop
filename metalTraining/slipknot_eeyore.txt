Meet the man that made me 
Greet the can that I came from 
Oh the fucking sacred heart of Jesus 
Blew it in the back room 
Feelin' like a real goon 
Slam the fuck aside, man 
I'm on - you're not 

I am the great big mouth 

Good riddance - though I'm sad to say 
I didn't get to kill you 
Rhetoric - Better look both ways 
I gotta get an arm through 
Stain 
What the fuck is up? Get the fuck away 
Run if you want to 
Innocent? You're a guilty conscience 
Laugh last - break through 
Stain 

Prepare you fucker 

I don't give a shit, bitch 
I don't give a fuck, bitch 
I don't understand, bitch 
You don't matter 
I don't give a fuck, man
I don't give a shit, man
I don't really care, man 
I'm the super sized man
