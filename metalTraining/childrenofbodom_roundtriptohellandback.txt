When I close my eyes I keep falling
Thought I’m plunging down it’s like flying
It’s funny how I’m so high yet never floated
So low
Just wanna revert from this horrid death row

And when I get back from numbness to feeling
Thinking I was out, I got pulled back in
Within this mother fucking

[Chorus]
Deathfall
Confinement of terror
Roundtrip
To Hell and back
Save me
Forever lost I’m in
Bounded
In a place that one was heaven

Please don’t let me go
Hold me tight
All I am asking
Is to make it right

[Solo]

[Chorus]

[Keyboard Solo]
