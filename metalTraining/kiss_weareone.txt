You are not alone and how long can you run
It's much to late if you dont know what you've got 'til it's gone
Once upon a time you were a child but that was yesterday
Believed that magic in your heart would never fade away

But hold your head up high and let your spirits fly
Keep hope alive yes deep inside and your dreams will never die

We are one
Everywhere I go, everyone I see
And I see my face looking back at me
We are one
Everything I know, what I know is true
Everyone of us is inside of you
We are one
We are one

Oooh take a breath, close your eyes you're on the road again
And then you realize they've brought you back to life again
Something's never change but if you fantasize
You'll feel it deep inside yourself and then you'll realize

When you feel it coming
When you hear the sound
You'll always laugh when you wanna cry
And then you'll know it deep inside

We are one
Everywhere I go, everyone I see
And I see my face looking back at me
We are one
Everything I know, what I know is true
Everyone of us is inside of you
We are one
We are one

You are me, I am you
What you see, is all true
(It's all true)
You are me, I am you
What you see, is all true
(It's all true)

You are me, I am you
(We are one)
What you see, is all true
(I am you) (We are one) (It's all true)
You are me, I am you
(We are one)
What you see, is all true
(We are one)

We are one
Everywhere I go, everyone I see
And I see my face looking back at me
We are one
Everything I know, what I know is true
Everyone of us is inside of you
We are one
We are one
