Internal terrorism
Multiple personalities
Inside the screams were deafening
Outside in silent agony

Curse coming down
A maelstrom of plagues

Medieval as Merlin
A pact for power was made
Mephistophelian transaction
A virgin soul, the price was paid

Scouring the days
The vortex of pain

A telestic message to you all
Written in torment
Howl out your dirges
Like a sonic blast

Distorted faces
Twisting in rage
Butt you head against the horns of the ram
You're tortured to appease
