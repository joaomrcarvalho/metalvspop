They say we are fools
We say look at you
Long ago we were just a few
Still say we don't need you

[Chorus:]
We don't wanna belong, we said all along, we just wanna be left alone
We don't wanna belong, we said all along, we just wanna be left alone

Think that we must have lost our way
Running from the blaze, you were wrong
Chose our course, counted off the days
Enduring inner rage, we got strong

[Chorus]

You deny everything that's good
Acting as you would with your shame
So we turned and left you all behind
We don't need your kind, you're to blame

[Chorus]

In the years to come you'll hear my name
When darkness falls on Judgment Day

They say we are fools
We say look at you
Long ago we were just a few
Still we say we don't need you
Think that we must have lost our way
Running from the blaze, you were wrong
We chose our course, counted off the days
Enduring inner rage, we got strong

[Chorus x2]
