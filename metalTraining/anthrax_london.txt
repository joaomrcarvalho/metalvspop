Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train, heave on to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

You left your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see the jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With the really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows that when he goes
He really goes
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
