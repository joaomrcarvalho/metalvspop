I saw the millions, the naked and the dead
I saw the city streets running bloody red
I saw a thousand bombers circle in the sky
I saw the firestorm fifty stores high

I saw a hundred thousand scream and burn
I saw the armored wheels grind and turn
Universal soldier, doomed to live to tell
Fight and die forever, burn in bloody hell

Death or Glory, Death or Glory
March forever in the sound and fury
Death or Glory, Death or Glory
Blood and iron it's the same old story

I held the Iron Cross, first class with the swords
I marched with Hitler down the bloody road to war
I was at Jutland loding 'till the gun was hot,
Killed at Trafalgar without firing a shot

I was at Moscow, burning in my tank
I was at Shiloh, marching in the ranks
I was a Sturmbannfuhrer fighting in Berlin
I was a Russian Hero dying for Stalin

Death or glory, Death or glory
March forever in the sound and fury
Death or glory, Death or glory
Blood and iron it's the same old story

I swung a saber and I was a young Hussar
I was a Cossack, fighting for the Czar
I was a Viking, Berserker from the North
A Roman Gladiator murdered just for sport

I was with Bonaparte I died at Waterloo
I was a Frankish Knight, a Polish Jew
I was a Spartan in the Trojan Wars
I was a warrior for Crazy Horse

Death or Glory, Death or Glory
March forever in the sound and fury
Death or Glory, Death or Glory
The Loner Survivor but no comfort for me
Death or Glory, Death or Glory
Executioner, Judge and Jury
Death or Glory, Death or Glory
Blood and iron it's the same old story
Auf Stehen!!!
