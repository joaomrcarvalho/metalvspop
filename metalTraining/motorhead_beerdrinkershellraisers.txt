If you see me walkin' down the line
With my favorite honky tonk in mind,
Well, I'll be here around suppertime
With my can of dinner and a bunch of fine.
Beer drinkers and hell raisers, yeah.
Uh-huh-huh, baby, don't you wanna come with me?
The crowd gets loud when the band gets right,
Steel guitar cryin' through the night.
Yeah, trying to cover up the corner fight
But everything's cool 'cause they's just tight.
Beer drinkers and hell raisers, yeah.
Huh, baby, don't you wanna come with me?
Ah, play it boy.
The joint was jumpin' like a cat on hot tin.
Lord, I thought the floor was gonna give in.
Soundin' a lot like a House Congressional
'Cause we're experimental and professional.
Beer drinkers, hell raisers, yeah.
Well, baby, don't you wanna come with me?
