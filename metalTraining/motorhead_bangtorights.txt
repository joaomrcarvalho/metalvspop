Took her to a bar, I though I'd covered all my tracks
Thought I had it made, I felt daggers in my back
You came walkin' through the door sailed into the attack
Don't seem to be my night
You got me bang to rights

I ain't gonna fight it baby, there ain't no excuse
Don't know what to tell ya, but I hope you don't cut loose
It don't matter anyway, my head is in the noose
You got me stitched up tight
You got me bang to rights

I can tell you ain't exactly listening to me
I just wish that I could thing of some place else to be
I'm gonna make it up to you, just you wait and see
My future ain't too bright
You got me bang to rights
