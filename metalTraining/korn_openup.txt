What were you thinking
I guess I'll never know
See your eyes blinking
Pupils begin to grow

Drilling you softly
Pulling you in
Making your mind up
What's sick or a sin

[Chorus]
Open up now
Let it all go
I'm quite certain
Say it ain't so
You're corrupted by
Some sick fuck
Oh no
Open up now
Head in the sky
Pierce the tongue that
Keeps telling lies
Feelings in my mouth
You breathe in but can't breathe out

What you've been taking
It makes you talk
Real slow
How come I'm thinking
You'd be the last
To know

(You'd be the last to know)

Choking you gently
Gaining control
Hand you the shovel
To dig your own hole

[Chorus]

Choking you gently
Gaining control
Hand you the shovel
To dig your own hole

Open up now
Let it all go
Open up now
Let it all go

Open up now
Head in the sky
Pierce the tongue that
Keeps telling lies
Feelings in my mouth
You breathe in but can't breathe out

You breathe in but can't breathe out
