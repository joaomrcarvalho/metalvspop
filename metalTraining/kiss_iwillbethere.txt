Each and every day
People turn away
Change the things they feel
Change the things they say

We can never know
Where our lives will lead
Wherever you go
Whenever you need

I will be there
Wanna be there
I will hear you when you call
Give you anything at all
I will be there
Anywhere
Like a father to his son

You are just a child
All is yet to be
Growing all the while
Knowing when you leave

I will be there
Wanna be there
Only blood will run so deep
Seal the promise I will keep
I will be there
Anywhere
Like a father to his son
I can swear to only one

Time moves quickly as the years go by
All these moments slip away
When I'm gone and life will carry on
You will know someway

I will be there
I will be there

I will be there
Wanna be there
Only blood will run so deep
Seal the promise I will keep
I will be there
Like a father to his son
I must swear to only one
