[Verse 1:]
You live your whole life staring at a wall,
Your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall.
You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?
There seems to be a difference, two different types of kids.
The ones who go out and the ones who are taught to live.
One groups taught how and the other group is taught why.

[Chorus:]
There's no need to tell you what's in mind,
But in the game of life I'm doing fine.
No reason to tell you which way to be.
The streets have opened my eyes to see.

No reason to tell you what's in mind,
But in the game of life I'm doing fine.
No reason to tell you which way to be,
The streets have opened my eyes to see!

[Verse 2:]
Look what's happening now.
What are the reasons why and how?
And don't you think it sounds stupid when someone's treated
Different cause they're not the same as me or you?

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]
