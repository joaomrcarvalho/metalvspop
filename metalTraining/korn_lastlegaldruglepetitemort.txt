Put your hand against your skin
Rub it gently to begin
You feel it?
Can you feel it?
When does pleasure become pain?
When does sex become insane?
You say yes
As you feel it

When you cum
(Be a good girl)
Hold your breathe
(Make it last long)
It's a mess
(it is called)
the little death, girl

[Chorus]
So please
When you die could you scream?
Mercy
Mercy for you and me
Its true
What they say fuck it boy
Love might be the last legal drug
So please
When you cry let it flow
I might
Make you stay, let you go
It's true
What they say fuck it boy
Love might be the last legal drug

Push that one more time that's all
And the rain begins to fall
You feel it?
Can you feel it?
People who ain't seen shit been
Telling you that its a sin
You say it
As you feel it

When you cum
(Be a good girl)
Hold your breathe
(Make it last long)
It's a mess
(it is called)
the little death, girl

[Chorus]

Le petite mort

[Chorus]
