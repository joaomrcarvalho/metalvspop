We want peace without 
Patriot missiles, 
Blown to bits are civilian targets, 
Parade! Laugh! Rejoice! Sing! 
We are the victors of...nothing, 
Spend more money on a war, 
Your people starving, turned to whores, 
Slaves of the chosen one paying millions for each bomb, 

Country without a race , 
Formed from people you disgrace , 
White right conservative might , 
Killers of Kennedy's with no fright , 
The American way! 

Freedom cried the marching man, 
Flags ripped out of their black hands , 
Beaten! Slain! Tortured! Killed! 
Their only mistake was being born here , 
Invade countries just for oil , 
Send your troops all down to boil , 
Iraq! Grenada! Nam and Chile! 
Truman doctrine our own way , 

Country without a race , 
Formed from people you disgrace , 
White right conservative might , 
Killers of Kennedy's with no fright , 
The American way! 

The Government here can suck my balls , 
Policing the world in overalls , 
Armed rebellion minority , 
Disrespected race, colored mind , 
Crazed loonies all walk the streets , 
Missing children on milk cartons , 
Mother selling child for crack , 
Mr. President check your back , 

Country without a race , 
Formed from people you disgrace, 
White right conservative might , 
Killers of Kennedy's with no fright , 
The American way! 
The American way! 
The American way!
