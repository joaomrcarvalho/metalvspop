I was alone, she was a woman,
I was a man, I never knew her name,
And she was pretty, New York City
I just gotta let it go,
The Train Kept A-Rollin' all night long
Get it on, cheap little woman get it on, on my way
Get it on, cheap little woman get it on, on my way
The Train Kept A-Rollin' all night long
The Train Kept A-Rollin' all night long
