All the pins are out
Nothing is leaking any more
No less than a thousand times
My brain's been scattered about
Forced to deal with suffering
I make it more than a hobby
Leave my past behind me
Life... LIFE
Show me, show me, SHOW ME

Now the pins are back in
I'm through with resort
Just one more time
To keep my face in

LIFE

Smile, while the blade slides down your face
Pain, for at least 2 or 3 days
You, will come to love all your scars
Feel, all the blessed release

SMILE, WHILE THE BLADE SLIDES DOWN YOUR FACE
