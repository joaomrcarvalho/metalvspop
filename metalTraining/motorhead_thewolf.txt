We never see the evil deed,
Nobody cares as long as they got what they need
Don't look for help, under attack,
Blind eyes are daggers, gonna stab you in the back
The wolf is at your door,
The wolf

This ain't the time, to talk of love
That word's forgotten when the fist is in the glove,
Don't you rely, on passers by,
They'd sooner look, the other way, and let you die
The wolf is at your door,
The wolf

Don't ask for why, don't ask for help,
Don't ask for anything, that you can't do yourself
The wolf is here, he's at your side
You better fight him, or it's you that's gonna die,
The wolf is at your door,
The wolf

Owwwwwwwwwww!!!
