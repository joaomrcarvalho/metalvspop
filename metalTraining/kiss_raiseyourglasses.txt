I took a ride with a one-way ticket
I aimed my arrow at the mark & hit it
We all need to be somebody

Been broken down, but not defeated
I kept on punching back till i succeeded
We all need to be somebody, now

We stop at nothing, even climb barbed-wire
We struck a match & set the world on fire
& if we tried, we couldn't get much higher, now

Everyone around the world, raise your glasses, raise your glasses
Standing pround cause we're the champions, raise your glasses, raise your glasses

We pushed it all, beyond the limit
We took our chances & we jumped right in it

Now i believe, in strength in numbers
Went into battle with a force of thunder
We all need to be somebody, now

I wanna shout it out with all my power
I wanna scream it from the highest tower
I want to celebrate our finest hour, now

Everyone around the world, raise your glasses, raise your glasses
Standing pround cause we're the champions, raise your glasses, raise your glasses

We stop at nothing, even climb barbed-wire
We struck a match & set the world on fire
& if we tried, we couldn't get much higher, now

Oh, you gotta give it your all
Oh, you gotta know what you're after
And oh, we'll make it over the wall together

I took a ride with a one way ticket
I shot my arrow at the mark & hit it
When all the others only talked, i did it
Kept pushing everything beyond the limit
You play the game, you gotta play to win it
