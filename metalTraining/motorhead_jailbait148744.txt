Hey baby you're a sweet young thing
Still tied to mommas apron strings
I don't even want to know your age
I'm just happy you're back stage
You're jailbait and I just can't wait
Jailbait baby come on

One look baby all I need
My decision made at lightning speed
I don't even want to know your name
It's enough to know you feel the same
You're jailbait and I just can't wait
Jailbait baby come on

Hey baby know you look so fine
Send shivers up and down my spine
I don't care about our different ages
I'm an open book with well-thumbed pages
You're jailbait and I just can't wait
Jailbait baby come on
