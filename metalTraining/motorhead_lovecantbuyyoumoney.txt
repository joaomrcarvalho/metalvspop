You dare to tell me what to do
You have a lot of nerve
Watch your mouth or you might get
The dentist you deserve
You're leaving soon, your awful doom
Example to us all
You be so far back you won't
Hear the hound-dogs call

Go Go, whaddya know
I know what the deal is
You might try to cop a feel
And I know what a feel is
You go out and you go down
Some might think it's funny
Prostitute, destitute
Love can't buy you money
Don't you know the way is slow
And you've run out of time
Watch your feet or you might fall
And it's been quite a climb
Breaks my heart to say good-bye
But that's the way it goes
Don't you see, the hanging tree
Get up on your toes

Well here we are among the stars
Dizzy from the rush
We can't see your face no more
Behind that burning bush
Your Bible hits the floor as we
Exchange our fond good-byes
Turned around & falling down
Funny how time flies
