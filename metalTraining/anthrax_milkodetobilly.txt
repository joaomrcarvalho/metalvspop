[Verse 1]
I woke up, can't wait to eat
Got my cereal by was I beat
Opened the fridge and to my dismay
There was no milk, my mother will pay

I want some milk! My coffee grows cold
I want some milk! I should've been told
Bridge I wish I had some Goddamn milk
Too bad the milkman never came

[Verse 2]
I can't go, out to the store
I'll just wait 'till mommy buys more
I'll just have wheat thins and beer
If I get kick the toilet is near

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
