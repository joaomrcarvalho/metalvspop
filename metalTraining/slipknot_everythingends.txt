You are wrong, fucked, and overrated 
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault 
This is the end of EVERYTHING 
You are the end of EVERYTHING 
I haven't slept since I woke up 
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker 
This is the end of EVERYTHING 
You are the end of EVERYTHING 

Shallow skin, I can paint with pain 
I mark the trails on my arms with your disdain 
Everyday it's the same - I LOVE, YOU HATE
But I guess I don't care any more... 
Fix my problems with the blade 
While my eyes turn from blue to gray 
God, the worst thing happened to me today 
But I guess I don't care anymore... 

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated 
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault 
This is the end of EVERYTHING 
You are the end of EVERYTHING 
I haven't slept since I woke up 
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker 
This is the end of EVERYTHING 
You are the end of EVERYTHING 

My flaws are the only thing left that's pure 
Can't really live, can't really endure 
Everything I see reminds me of her 
God I wish I didn't care anymore 
The more I touch, the less I feel 
I'm lying to myself that it's not real 
Why is everybody making such a big fucking deal? 
I'm never gonna care anymore 

What the hell am I doing? 
Is there anyone left in my life? 
What the fuck was I thinking? 
Anybody want to tell me I'm fine? 
Where the hell am I going? 
Do I even need a reason to hide? 
I am only betrayed 
I am only conditioned to die
