Conflict, terror, hear the noise
You're in the edge of a nerve-racking force
Oh my god, here's a fight
Never siege, never riot, must defy

When you look at me, what do you see?
Another trophy like a fucking dead beat
Close your eyes, take a step with me
Guess what, there's no time to waste
Insanity and abnormality is not what you call reality
What you will, always want
It was the day that you should die

I don't give a flying **** mother******
I don't give a flying **** mother******
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying ****!

I'll never wait for the pain of death
With a bullet in my gun don't fuck over my ****
Can you hold my crazy as I go
So fuck hypocrisy and fuck you too

INCOMING!

[Chorus:]
Say one, more word
I double-dare you, BRING IT ON!
Its my world, you're in it
It'll take you down in a minute
You can alter your look
And diversify your rage
But the truth seems like a bitchslap in your face

When you look at me, what do you see
Another trophy like a fuckin dead beat
Close your eyes, take a step inside?
Insanity and normality is not what you call reality
What you will, always want
It was the day that you should die

I don't give a flying **** mother******
I don't give a flying **** mother******
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying ****!

INCOMING!

[Chorus:]
Say one, more word
I double-dare you, BRING IT ON!
Its my world, you're in it
It'll take you down in a minute
You can alter your look
And diversify your rage
But the truth seems like a bitchslap in your face

INCOMING!
