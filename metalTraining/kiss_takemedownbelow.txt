I saw her standing there accross the room
A glass of wine and some sweat perfume
Next thing I knew
She was standing right next to me (oh, yeah!)
I told her that I had a submarine
She said, "I know exactly what you mean"
I told that my ship was ready to ride
She touched my heart when she touched my thigh

She said, take me down below
It doesn't matter where we go
Yeah, I understand
Lead me by the hand
Won't you take me down below (yeah)

I took an elevator late one night
This lady by my side looked like she might
The doors were closing
When I asked her to take a ride with me (come here baby!)
She took my finger, here's a button to press
I raised my thang and she dropped her dress
I'll take you on a cruise you'll never forget
She said, "we better move 'cause I'm already wet"

She said, take me down below (yeah, yeah)
It doesn't matter where we go (it doesn't matter where we go)
Yeah, I understand
Lead me by the hand
Won't you take me down below (take me)

I took a flight at night from east to west
I asked the hostess for my flying test
She threw the covers and we started to rock
She whispered, "you can take me bottom or top" (yeah)

C'mon, c'mon

Take me down below (c'mon down below)
It doesn't matter where we go (it doesn't matter where we go)
Yeah, I understand
Lead me by the hand
Won't you take me down below (oh yeah)
Take me down below (yeah, yeah)
Won't you take me down below (you know you wanted it)
Take me down below (oh yeah)
Won't you take me down below
