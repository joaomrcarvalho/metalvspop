We too feel alone

That place in my mind 
Is that space that you call mine 
That place in my mind 
Is that space that you call mine 

Where have I been all this time? 
Lost enslaved fatal decline 
I've been waiting for this to unfold (Good) 
The pieces are only as good as the whole 

Severed myself from my whole life
Cut out the only thing that was right 
What If I never saw you again 
I'd die right next to you in the end 

That place in my mind 
Is that space that you call mine 
That place in my mind 
Is that space that you call mine 

I won't let you walk away 
Without hearing what I have to say 
Without hearing what I have to say 
Without hearing what I have to say
