I like the way you're so fucked up
Naked and wearing no makeup
I watch your pulse beneath your skin
Sometimes I wish I could crawl in
I don't care what you talk like
I don't care how you dress
I don't care 'bout your facial features
I couldn't care less
I don't need conversation
I've got nothing to say
I know what you're about
I want you inside out
I like the way your lips contract
When you are lying on your back
The thrills and yells eternalize
The thoughts behind those crazy eyes
I don't care what you talk like
I don't care how you dress
I don't care 'bout your facial features
I couldn't care less
I don't need conversation
I've got nothing to say
I know what you're about
I want you inside out
Bitch so untamed but outside it, a work of art
But underneath it you're beautiful when you're torn apart
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard
I drink the milk that's in your breast
I wouldn't even mind your shit
I put my tongue inside your ear
I'm gonna eat you up right here
I don't care what you talk like
I don't care how you dress
I don't care 'bout your facial features
I couldn't care less
I don't need conversation
I've got nothing to say
I know what you're about
I want you, inside out
Inside out, inside out
Inside out, inside out
Inside out, inside out
Inside out, inside out
