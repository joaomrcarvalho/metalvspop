Grinding my teeth, with knuckles grasp at the wheel
I rush from an avalanche of adrenaline, it's all that I feel
As quick as a bolt of lightning, a rocket ride in a bucket seat
It doesn't get any better than this, it just feeds my need for speed

[Chorus:]
Supercharged, strapped in and screaming
Fire spiting from the pipes
A burnout by the flame throwing fury
8,000 horses ignite
Full throttle, hit the ground running
With a tank full of nitro
And its 1,320' to go to the finish line

[Solo - Chris]

My hands hold tight, a fire breathing stampede
I fall into a trance, hold my breath till the light turns green
In a cloud of nitro methane, melting rubber, I say my prayers
Man and machine accelerate and I vanish in thin air

[Chorus]

[Solo - Dave, Chris, Dave, Chris, Dave, Chris]
