And my plate is full
And I feel the pull
And my time is spent
Searching for something that came and went

Take me back
Take me back to a golden time
From '75 to '79
And it makes it easy, so easy for me

Strap it on
Strap it on my old school
I change by staying the same (I seem to remember this line)

And it grows inside
Metastasize
And my brain goes crazy
Sepia toned days are hazy

Take me back
Take me back to the heavy time
From '85 to '89
It makes it easy so easy for me.
