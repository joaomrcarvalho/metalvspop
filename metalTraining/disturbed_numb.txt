Bleeding I'm
Crying I'm
Falling I'm
Bleeding out. Oh
Bleeding I'm
Crying I'm
Falling I'm
Bleeding out

Bleeding now I'm
Crying out I'm
Falling down and I'm
Feeling nothing like
Laughing now I'm
Stopping now I'm
Reaching out and I'm
Feeling nothing

Yeah, you've created a rift within me
Now there have been several complications
That have left me feeling nothing
I might say, you were wrong to take it from me
Left me feeling nothing

Crawling now I'm
Beaten down I'm
Tortured now and I'm
Feeling nothing like
Hunting now I'm
Stalking now I'm
Reaching out and I'm
Killing nothing

Yeah, you've created a rift within me
Now there have been several complications
That have left me feeling nothing
I might say, you were wrong to take it from me
Left me feeling nothing

I can feel you ripping and tearing
Feeding and growing inside of me
Ripping and tearing and
Feeding and growing inside of me
I want this, more than you know
I need this, give it back to me

You've created a rift within me
You are the cause of these horrid complications
That are ripping and tearing and feeding and growing inside of me
Yeah, you've created a rift within me
Now there have been several complications
That are ripping, tearing
Feeding, growing
Ripping, tearing
Ripping and tearing and feeding and growing inside of me

I want this
More than you know
I need this
Give it back to me
