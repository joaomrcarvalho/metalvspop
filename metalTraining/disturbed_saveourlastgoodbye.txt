"Hello?"
"Please leave a message after the tone"
"Hey just calling you back doing pretty good today actually, didn't throw up at all.
Yeah tomorrow I got this procedure, I think everything's gonna go smooth there is all.
I'm hoping anyways. I need some good news for once."

Don't want to hear it's over
What a rude awakening
The angel of death has come
And ripped you from my lives
I can't stand the devastation
Relentless agony
Hope that I get to see you
On the other side

Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore

What faith I had is broken
And I question everything
And those shards of doubt
Begin to penetrate my heart
With every waking hour
Within everything I see
The shadows of your loss
Are tearing me apart

Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore

"We're sorry, this mailbox is full and can not taking messages"

My world is shattered, in disarray
I'm beaten down, drained emotionally
They say in time the pain goes away
But in my soul it will forever stay

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore

"We're sorry, you've reached a number that is no longer in service"
