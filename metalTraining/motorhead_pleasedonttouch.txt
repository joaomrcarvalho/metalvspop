Well there ain't no other woman
that can make me feel this way,
Gets up close you know, I just ain't got a word to say.

PLEASE DON'T TOUCH
I shake so much,
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH
I shake so much.

I don't know why she's got her claws in me,
'Cause I ain't fighting baby, can't you see,
Sneaking up the stairway, running like a thief,
Spend the night shaking like a leaf,
Oh I remember the first time I took her to a cheap motel,
Well I woke up drunk, you know I felt like Eskimo Nell.

PLEASE DON'T TOUCH
I shake so much,
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH
I shake so much.

Well I get so nervous when I see his eyes that shine,
Gets too close and a chill runs down my spine.

PLEASE DON'T TOUCH
I shake so much,
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH
I shake so much.
