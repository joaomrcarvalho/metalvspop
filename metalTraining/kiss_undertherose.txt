Though you may be pure of heart
And free of sin
And though you have been chosen
To begin
And yet you must be worthy of
The prophecy
But seek and you shall find
Your destiny

Loneliness will haunt you
Will you sacrifice?
Do you take the oath
Will you live your life
Under the rose

The more you hurt the less you feel
The pain
And the more you change, the more you stay
The same
But now before you lies the quest
At hand
And from this boy you may become
A man

Do you understand
Will you sacrifice?
Do you take the oath
Will you live your life
Under the rose
