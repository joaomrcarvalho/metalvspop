I know why Judas wept, motherfucker

The fires burn on the summit
Shining a light on the ones I've killed
Survivor's guilt - undetermined
I could murder the world in all the blood I've spilled

Banishment
Sequestered and conquered
To hell with your intelligence
Just figure out your common sense

No one is bulletproof

And I'll eat the skins of my brothers
The alabaster bones will make a perfect wall
Gonna fill in the cracks of these feelings
With every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all

Selfishness
Take granted for everything
What more could you ask for?
It doesn't matter anymore

No one is bulletproof

Can you feel the cold?
Fortune never favors the old
Tired of defending myself
Go complain to somebody else
Somebody else

The masses and your madness
Are the voices in your head
They're smashing out your windows
That you worked for beneath your bed
You live right fucking heathens
So you'll die like pagan gods
In between the poisons and the pure
Contagions and the charm

Nine for sure

And I have only sand inside of me
It's a rotting sick that I don't need
To pene-vent your interro-gration
I can believe I'm saying this
I'll live with my regrets
I'll die by my decisions
I'm not your fucking superstar
Keep it closed, you're going way too far

No one is bulletproof
Bulletproof
No one is bulletproof
Bulletproof
No one is bulletproof
Bulletproof
