[Intro:]
City authorities in your area
Have reported that the bodies of the dead
Are rising from the graves
And attacking the living

When did this begin
This curse as old as sin
Reality is bleeding at the core
Brilliant savagery
Decapitate and bleed
Out the spoiled seed until it's pure

The darkest devil nightmare blacker than their evil souls you gotta fight em'
I'll end you
God save us prayers fall on deaf ears so put your faith in force you gotta fight em;
I'll end you
The murder in your eyes is just the will to stay alive you gotta fight em'
I'll end you
Cause there's no humanity when the dead come back to feed you gotta fight em
Fight em'

In the end of everything
The dead will rise and sing
Fight em' til you can't fight no more
The world is only blood
Rage becomes your love
Fight em' til you can't fight no more

I will end you
Kill and kill the thing
It's mind shattering
When murder is
The only cure
Brilliant savagery
Decapitate and bleed
Out the spoiled seed until it's pure

The darkest devil nightmare blacker than their evil souls you gotta fight em'
I'll end you
God save us prayers fall on deaf ears so put your faith in force you gotta fight em;
I'll end you
The murder in your eyes is just the will to stay alive you gotta fight em'
I'll end you
Cause there's no humanity when the dead come back to feed you gotta fight em
Fight em'

In the end of everything
The dead will rise and sing
Fight em' til you can't fight no more
The world is only blood
Rage becomes your love
Fight em' til you can't fight no more
