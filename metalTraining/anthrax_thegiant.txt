It’s not so bad, I’m Dr. Strange
My broken heart, I have to face
My broken heart, Hell’s on its way

My time to start, procrastinate
I feel alive, I fucking hate
There’s nothing left, there’s nothing right
If there’s no point, why do we fight?

Welcome to my vicious circle
Trying to escape, break out!
Playing with my knife until it cuts me
Giant walking, no more talking
In my way and one way out
Fighting me forever, I’ll break the giant down

Caught between the lines of right and wrong yeah
Caught between the things that I don’t know
Up and down the mountain climbing, climbing
Drowning in a ocean to find my soul

I have to win, I never lose
I’ll have my way, you have to choose
War all the time, I’m fucking fierce
War all the time, what do I fear?
The giant walks, the giant eats
Out of control, the giant beats
And breaks you down, with all your might
With nothing left, and still I fight
