I'm facing the light
But fading to black
I'm offering peace
As I'm stabbed in the back

Yet I'm feeling able
My house is made of steel
With paper for doors

I've tried to hate you
But feel regret
I'm most uncertain
I've lost the bet
I'm waiting to watch it
I'm waiting to see
Is this my overture? Or obituary?

I'm holding the torch
But melting my fists
I'm first in the line
Yet last on the list

Yet I'm feeling able
My house is made of steel
With paper for doors

I've tried to hate you
But feel regret
I'm most uncertain
I've lost the bet
I'm waiting to watch it
I'm waiting to see
Is this my overture? Or obituary?

Or obituary!

I tried not to choke you (NO!)
But now you're dead (NO!)
I'm most uncertain (NO!)
Should I feel regret? (NO!)

I've tried to hate you
But feel regret
I'm most uncertain
I've lost the bet
I'm waiting to watch it
I'm waiting to see
Is this my overture? Or obituary?

I tried not to choke you!

Is this my overture? Or obituary?
