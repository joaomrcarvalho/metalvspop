Stripped of life, alone
In the midst of something that I
Want to play with your evil inside
wanting, letting go, of what never could be again
Lost and alone
Imprisoned now inside your mind
With the way you tried
To destroy me again
You were waiting and living for no one
With the way you tried
To completely refuse all your life

Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me

[Chorus:]
Awaken you
With a little evil inside
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me
I've stricken you
I don't want to live with the lie
Feed on your nothing
And you'll never live up to me

Awaken you, oh no,
Can't live up to me
I've striken you
Feed on your nothing and you'll never live up to me
Stripped of life, alone
In the midst of something that I
Want to play with your evil inside
wanting, letting go, of what never could be again
Lost and alone
Imprisoned now inside your mind
With the way you tried
To destroy me again
You were waiting and living for no one
With the way you tried
To completely refuse all your life

Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me

[Chorus]

There isn't a thing that I can do
Watching the whole thing just wash away
Making me wrong
Making you strong

[Chorus:]
Awaken you
With a little evil inside
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me
I've stricken you
I don't want to live with the lie
Feed on your nothing
And you'll never live up to me
Oh can't live upto me
Feed on your nothing, you'll never live upto me.
