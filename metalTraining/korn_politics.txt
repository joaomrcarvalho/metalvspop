Everyone's corrupt
You should just shut up
Lay down, back off
The demon you disrupted

Don't want to talk about politics
Don't preach or talk about politics
Don't make me talk about politics
Don't give a shit about politics

You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know
Think that's the way to go don't you?
It's in religion, sex, and everything we do and say
I look the other way won't you?

Everybody's race
Lying to your face
Kick's you in the gut
Slayed you here all messed up

Don't want to talk about politics
Don't preach or talk about politics
Don't make me talk about politics
Don't give a shit about politics

You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know
Think that's the way to go don't you?
It's in religion, sex, and everything we do and say
I look the other way won't you?

Tiny splinters are in your soul (and they remain there)
Darkest life in the deepest hole (you sit and pray there)
All the deals from the things you've done (you wouldn't ever work for)
What you thought was so much fun (you have to pay for)

Don't want to talk about politics
Don't preach or talk about politics
Don't make me talk about politics
Don't give a shit about politics

You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know
Think that's the way to go don't you?
It's in religion, sex, and everything we do and say
I look the other way won't you?

Don't want to talk about politics
Don't preach or talk about politics
Don't make me talk about politics
Don't give a shit about politics

Don't want to talk about politics
Don't preach or talk about politics
Don't make me talk about politics
Don't give a shit about politics!
