Help me, I am breaking
And my heart is barely beating,
And the demons, they are creeping around
Take me, I am sinking
And my lungs are barely breathing
As the angels put me into the ground

And everybody’s peeking
No ones makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving
Paranoid and aroused

Help me, I am shaking
And my guts are really aching
And the demons they’re laughing out loud
Spare me, I am fading
And my will is dissapating
As the angels put me into the ground

And everybody’s peeking
No ones makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving
Paranoid and aroused

My mind is debating, these lesions are making
This mess is sedating, the power embracing
The bullshit I’m facing, my feelings of hating
Reality is failing, this shit is degrading

And everybody’s peeking
No ones makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving
Paranoid and aroused
