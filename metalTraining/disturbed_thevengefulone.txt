As I survey the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness for all I've seen
A degradation I cannot forget

So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moments of a dying world
What have you become
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
Their human predators... all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their role
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised

So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moments of a dying world
What have you become
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

When you die
You'll know why
For you cannot be saved
With all the world enslaved
When you die
You'll know why

When you die
You'll know why
For you could not be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die
You'll know why

I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moments of a dying world
What have you become
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
