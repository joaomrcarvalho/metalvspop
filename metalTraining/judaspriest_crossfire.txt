Watch your own reflection
Read between the lines
Lost in this confusion
It's a sign of the times

Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go
Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go

Opium for the masses
World's gone deaf and dumb
Victims of insanity
Ruled by the gun

Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go
Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go

Too much information
Messes with your mind
Pushing back the enemy
Blind leads the blind

World of smoking mirrors
Leaves you in a daze
Find your own solution
Out of the maze

Searing on the bible
Hypocrites and fools
Losing your religion
Breaking all the rules

Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go
Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go
