The end will crush the light
And sends a message, It won't please
The naked eye
Without and end there is no light
To foretell, to blind you
The law of the claw reigns on and after still

When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll rise, I cast a shadow

I'm leaving more eyes open
I close up both of mine
For the ones that chase my life
They're looking over shoulders
Let paranoia in
Spontaneously rule them

When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll fly, I cast a shadow

Everybody get fucking up!
I cast a shadow...
I... I cast a shadow
I cast a shadow...
I... I cast a shadow

When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll rise, I cast a shadow
