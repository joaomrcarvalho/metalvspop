Round, round 
Circumventing circuses 
lamenting in process 
to visible police 
prescence sponsored fear 
batallions of riot police 
with rubber bullet kisses 
baton courtesy 
service with a smile 
Beyond the staples center you can see america 
with it's tired poor avenging disgrace 
peaceful loving youth against the brutality 
of plastic existence 
pushing little children 
with their fully automatics 
they like to push the weak around 
pushing little children 
with their fully automatics 
they like to push the weak around 
round, round 
A rush of words 
pleading to disperse 
upon your naked walls, alive 
A political call 
the fall guy accord 
we can't afford to be neutral on a moving train 
Beyond the staples center you can see america 
with it's tired poor avenging disgrace 
peaceful loving youth against the brutality 
of plastic existence 
pushing little children 
with their fully automatics 
they like to push the weak around 
pushing little children 
with their fully automatics 
they like to push the weak around 
A deer dance, invitation to peace 
war staring you in the face, dressed in black 
with a helmet, fierce 
trained and appropriate for the malcontents 
for the disproportioned malcontents. 
The little boy smiled, it'll all be well 
The little boy smiled, it'll all be well 
Pushing little children 
with their fully automatics 
they like to push the weak around 
Pushing little children 
with their fully automatics 
they like to push the weak around 
Push the weak around 
Push the weak around 
Push the weak around 
They like to push the weak around.
