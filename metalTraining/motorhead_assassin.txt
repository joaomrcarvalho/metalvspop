Die now, no more time
I am death. The hand is mine
Great honour comes to thee

Tonight in my reach
Assassin, Assassin, Assassin, Assassin
Your years all dust, speak my name.

Assassin, Assassin, Assassin, Assassin
We shall see, as before, you are marked, my heart is pure

Great honour falls to me. I come tonight, the hand is mine
Assassin, Assassin, Assassin, Assassin
Your years all dust, speak my name.
Assassin, Assassin, Assassin, Assassin

Assassin, Assassin, Assassin, Assassin
Desert be thy grave

Thy life be mine to take or save
Mine eye upon thee
I taste thy death

I am assassin
Look well, see my face, I am death, I will not wait.

Great armies shall bow to me. I come tonight, the hand is mine
Assassin, Assassin, Assassin, Assassin
Your years all dust, speak my name.
Assassin, Assassin, Assassin, Assassin

Assassin, Assassin, Assassin, Assassin

Desert be thy grave
Thy life be mine to take or save
Mine eye upon thee
I taste thy death
I am assassin

And many be thy sins
Thy life be forfeit, the heart within, should flinch now dog
and freeze thy spine, I want thy life, the hand is mine
Now blood, is satisfied

I ride by night, to make thee die
My hand upon thee, my heart is pure
I am assassin
I smiled, I dreamed thy fear
My arm is long to reach thee here
All men shall tremble, their houses fall
I am assassin
