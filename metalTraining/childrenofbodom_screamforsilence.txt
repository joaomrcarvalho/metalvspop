It's a long way to the top of rockbottom
Bottoms up. lets drown my sorrow

If you need to feed on pain. you might as well tap my vein

And tomorrow screams for silence
The chaos whispers violence..
It screams out the truth and the truth never speaks in love

Never wanted to be the reason. why I'm ending up alone.
I cry out at my reflection. just to hear that no one's home

Hey! what happens if you're still alive?
Will you suffer enough to cry?
If tears infest our holy ground.
That world will spin around

I'm content. I'm high

You wouldn't dare
To touch. to feel..
Its not like you would care

I'm safe. I’ll fly.. and I will try

You forewent. good bye
You say as I die
