Walking alone inside my world
Thinking I'm doing the right thing
Destroying all that appears before me
It was all done, in vein

Wanna get through fire
Wanna get through pain
Wanna get with violence
Wanna get with shame

Taking this place to call my own
Raping my body without a face
Torching my soul as black as pitch
And I have no life to waste

Wanna get through fire
Wanna get through pain
Wanna get with violence
Wanna get with shame

(I worshipped you
Do anything
So lost and helpless
I played your game)

I worshipped you (I worshipped you)
Do anything (Do anything)
So lost and helpless (So lost and helpless)
I PLAYED YOUR GAME!

Wanna get through fire
Wanna get through pain
Wanna get with violence
Wanna get with shame
