[1st verse:]
Here we go again on a 747,
Looking at the clouds from the other side of heaven,
Smoking & drinking, never gonna stop,
Reading magazines stop me looking at the clock,
Wanna watch the movie, can't sit still,
Flying down to Rio, going to Brazil,

[2nd verse:]
Watching all the road crew attacking little girls,
Joined the mile high club, goin' round the world,
All the booze is free, airline going broke,
Here comes the lady with another Jack 'n' Coke
Wanna watch the movie, can't sit still,
Flying down to Rio, going to Brazil,

[Guitar solo]

[3rd verse:]
Steve, Clem, Hobbsy, John, Crazy Dil & Pappy,
Had to travel second class, they ain't too fucking happy,
Elevator music, butter in my ears,
Think we're gonna die just the pilot changing gear,
Wanna watch the movie, can't sit still,
Flying down to Rio, going to Brazil.

na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Maggots!
