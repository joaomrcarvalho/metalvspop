GO!

Don't be sheltered hear the noise
You are the answer their fucking poise
But, oh, my god, you're so fine
You seize the rogue and flesh divine

One look at me, what do you see?
Another junkie like a fucking dead beat
Ask your eyes, they discriminate
You're soft... no time to waste

The discrimination animosity
Your fault to ignore reality
What you will a way to fight
Get one thing all there is to die

I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying fuck

One step away from having a fit
With the parting of my soul don't work with my shit
Did hear I'm crazy, yes, I do
So fuck the father and fuck you too

Incoming!

They want the world
I don't dare you... (bring it on)
It's my world you're in it
It'll take you down in a minute

If you've not done you'll look
Diversify your ranks
But the truth... seems like
A big scythe in your face

One look at me - what do you see?
Another junkie and a fucking dead beat
Ask your eyes they descriminate
You're soft and no time to waste

The descrimination animality
Your fault to ignore reality
What you will a way to fight
Get one thing all there is to die

I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying fuck
