[Verse 1:]
Well let me tell why
Or did you tell your swine
"Another day goes by"
So why do you see me swept in blood

[Verse 2:]
So lets just fight
Wait for a dawn
Something sweeps by in pride
Erasing another life

[Chorus:]
I am the chosen, next in line, sent to slaughter all mankind
Reap the souls born to die, no reason for you to fight

[Verse 3:]
My chance is fine
I cant stop screaming for
Fuck them!
We've been obliged to sign
And relieved of our life

[Repeat Chorus]
