Here we go again motherfucker

Come on down and see the idiot right here
too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
Whats the matter with calamity anyways?
right? get the fuck out of my face
understand I cant feel anything
it isn't like I wanna sift through the decay
I feel like a wound
and like I got a fucking gun against my head
you live when I'm dead

One more time motherfucker

Everybody hates me now so fuck it
blood's on my face and my hands don't know why,I'm not afraid to cry
but that's none of your business
Whose life is it? Get it? see it? feel it? eat it? spin it around
so I can spit in his face
I wanna leave without a trace
get out, I don't want to die in this place

people=shit
people=shit (what you gonna do)
people=shit ( cuz I'm not afraid of you)
people=shit (I'm everything you'll never be)
people=shit

It never stops
you can't be everything to everyone 

Contagion I'm sittin on the side of satan
what do you want from me?
They never told me the failure I was meant to be
Overdo it, don't tell me you blew it, stop your bitchin'
and fight your way through it
I'm not like you
I just fuck up

c'mon mother fucker everybody has to die
c'mon mother fucker everybody has to die !!

people=shit
people=shit (what you gonna do)
people=shit ( cuz I'm not afraid of you)
people=shit (I'm everything you'll never be)
people=shit
