Who! Who!
Who! Who!
Who! Who!
Who! Who!

You once were someone I could dignify (Ah! Ah!)
A guiding force, in which I thought I could rely
I watched as you began to metamorphosize (Ah!)
Can't face it anymore, it's eating me alive

I'm not able to recognize
Where does the answer lie?
You're no longer the same
Is there nothing more that I can do?

Who! Who! Who the hell are you?
Who! Who! Who the fuck are you?

You were someone in whom I could confide (Ah! Ah!)
But you pushed me further away with every single lie
You used to have a soul, but it has surely died (Ah!)
What happened? When did you turn to the other side?

No longer able to recognize
For every word's a lie
You are forever changed
And there's nothing more that I can do

Who! Who! Who the hell are you?
Who! Who! Who the fuck are you?

Oh!

You and I, we were once so...
You and I, it was once incredible
You and I, we were once so...
You and I, we were indivisible

You and I, were once two of a kind
Where did all your innocence go?
Now I wonder how it happened

That you and I, we were once so...
You and I, we were once inseparable
You and I, we were once like Gemini
It was undeniable

You and I, we were once two of a kind
Where did my deliverance go?
Can there be a mend to this divide?

I'm not able to recognize
Where does the answer lie?
You're no longer the same
Is there nothing more that I can do?

Who! Who! Who the hell are you?
Who! Who! Who the fuck are you?

(Where does the answer lie?
Where does the answer lie?
It is eating me alive)
Who! Who! Who the fuck are you?

(Where does the answer lie?
Where does the answer lie?
It is eating me alive)
Who! Who! Who the fuck are you?

Who! Who!
Who the fuck are you?

Who! Who!
Who the fuck are you?
