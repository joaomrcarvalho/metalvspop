Stepping out, I'm leaving here,
No use crying, crying in my beer,
Enough's enough, believe it's true,
Bite The Bullet, I'm leaving you

Said goodbye, I left a note,
But I don't remember, just what I wrote,
The same old words, to say we're through,
Bite The Bullet, I'm leaving you

So that's the way it always ends,
Get sympathy from all your friends,
Seems there's nothing, nothing else to do,
Bite The Bullet, I'm leaving you
