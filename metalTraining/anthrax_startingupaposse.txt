Now I'm gonna tell you a story
A tale of wrong and right
And freedom is the reason
You can't take it without a fight

[Verse 1:]
So now I'm startin' up a posse (Suck my dick, suck my dick)
To come and look for you (Suck my dick, suck my dick)
We're gonna put a stop (Suck my dick, suck my dick)
To what you want to do (Suck my dick, suck my dick)
You fuckin' whores (you fuckin' whores)
That's all you are

[Verse 2:]
You say our records are offensive (You're a douche, You're a douche)
Our message ain't right (You're a douche, You're a douche)
You say we're gonna label records (You're a douche, You're a douche)
So our kids can grow up right (You're a douche, You're a douche)
You fuckin' whores (let them decide)
That's all you are

[Chorus:]
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
These seven words you're trying to take
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
Right or wrong it's our choice to make
America the beautiful, Land of the Free
Don't change the words to Land Of Hypocrisy

[Lead: Scott]
You're a whore aren't ya?

[Verse 3:]
Now I'm startin' up a posse (Fascist scum, Fascist scum)
And we'll damn sure make you see (Fascist scum, Fascist scum)
Something that offends you (Fascist scum, Fascist scum)
May not be offensive to me (Fascist scum, Fascist scum)
You fuckin' whores (you fuckin' whores)
That's all you are

Now you might take offense
To a word like "Fuck" or "Shit" (Dick!)
But you fuckin' don't have the right (Cunt!)
To discriminate me for saying it
You fuckin' whores (you fuckin' whores)
That's all you are

Go suck a dick, huh!

[Chorus]

[Verse 5:]
So now I'm startin' up a posse (mother fucker, mother fuck)
To right for freedom of choice (mother fucker, mother fuck)
To fight for freedom of speech (mother fucker, mother fuck)
We're gonna make you hear our voice (mother fucker, mother fuck)

[Verse 6:]
And now I don't do this to shock you (That's the end, that's the end)
I don't do this for spite (That's the end, that's the end)
You've got the choice: don't buy it, don't read it (That's the end, that's the end)
And don't say your opinion's right (That's the end, that's the end)
You fuckin' whores (you fuckin' whores)
That's all you are (cunty, cunty, cunty, cunt)

[Verse 7:]
You know you can't censor my feelings
You can't censor my thoughts
Censorship's against,
Everything America stands for
You fuckin' wores (let us decide)
That' all you are

And this ain't sexist either.

[Chorus]
