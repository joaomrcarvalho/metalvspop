Tore it up again, I couldn’t stop again
Let it go till there was nothing in the way
Fought the feeling then, I gave in again
Sweet surrender to the angel I denied
When you came to life I was terrified
I knew that nothing else would ever feel the same
Doubt came over me; what kind of father would I be?
I knew the time had come to stand up and be a man
To change the face of my life
With your future in mind
Time to do what is right
A new beginning

The world around me died
When I saw that heartbeat
I knew it wasn’t a sin
Can someone tell me why
This has happened to me?
Why was it only in death
Were you redeemed, my child?

No serenity within agony
Every day brings on
A hundred ways to fight
Constant scrutiny
I can feel you judging me
Resurrecting every demon that’s inside
Her face was horrified
You struggled still alive
My one desire was to trade my soul for yours
Grief crippled me, the reaper cheated me
Left me yearning for the path I'd come to adore
To change the face of my life
With your future in mind
Time to do what is right
A new beginning

The world around me died
When I saw that heartbeat
I knew it wasn’t a sin
Can someone tell me why
This has happened to me?
Why was it only in death
Were you redeemed, my child?

My child

The world around me died
When I saw that heartbeat
I knew it wasn’t a sin
Can someone tell me why
This has happened to me?
Why was it only in death
Were you redeemed, my child?

I pray you were redeemed, my child
