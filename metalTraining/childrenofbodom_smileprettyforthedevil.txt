Live the years of danger live on the road
To the point there's nothing to lose
Regrets all you want it to be!

In the blink of an eye you're fighting
Look at me chump, champ is my name
Were you going to all laugh? I'll always be

Five times I've died it's all the same
got only myself to blame
Never begged for you to rescue me
Then again I never could find you
but you leave me ripe to choke
Who gives a fuck and your the devil

And now, wont we find out
Just how we should get down in hell
Funny, you don't seem that big time
Memorize that your better
when your smiling pretty for the devil

Ten times I've died its all the same
Well I got myself to blame
Never begged for you to rescue me
Then again no one could find you
Because you leave me ripe to choke
Who gets the fuck and your the devil

And now, war will find you
This hour, you should live in hell
Funny, you don't seem that big time
Memorize that your better
when you smile pretty for the devil
