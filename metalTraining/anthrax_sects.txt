Acting like Mo Jo's
Acting like body bagger's
Let the bells ring
Rejoice and sing

Jim Jones, where did you come from
Jim Jones, was it for fun
Jim Jones, that's your name
Jim Jones, style of death

This sects the promised land
Are you ready to all meet God?
Bart's killers holding hands
Do not fight the odds
Try to make 'em sick drink up
Be merry and be dead

Jim Jones, where did you come from
Jim Jones, Was it for fun
Jim Jones, That's your name
Jim Jones, Style of death

Murder! Murder! Murder!
The Zero Hero

Some of them might get sex
Together with that boring joke
Mercenaries disciples
With bibles and rifles
In temple of people
To The Book of people
No poster hanging high

And I do, but I don't ask why
And I do, But I don't ask why
And I do, But I don't ask why
And I do, But I don't ask why
And I do, But I don't ask why
And I do, But I don't ask why
And I do, But I don't ask why..
Ah ha, ha, ha, ha
Oh Lord you die
