Relax... it's over,
You belong to me,
I fill your mouth with dirt
Relax... it's over,
You can never leave
I take your second digit with me... love...

You are my first,
I can barely breathe
I find you fascinating
You are my favorite,
Lay you down to sleep
It's all that I can do to stop... love...

So blue, so broken,
Paper doll decays
I haven't left you yet
So cold, subversive,
Your eyes are full of bleach
Tomorrow I will go away again... love...

YOU ARE MINE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MINE,
I CAN TEAR YOU APART
I CAN RECOMBINE YOU
ALL I WANT IS TO COVET YOU ALL
YOU BELONG TO ME
I WILL KILL YOU TO LOVE YOU (LOVE).
