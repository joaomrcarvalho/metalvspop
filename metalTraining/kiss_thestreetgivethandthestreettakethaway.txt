Hey man, gotta take a stand, so you think that you've been had
I'm here to bet ya, street's gonna get ya, well two out of three ain't bad
Hey man, it's gettin' out of hand, cross your heart and hope to die

You got yours, and I got mine, I'm gonna get what's comin' to ya

[Chorus:]
'Cause the street giveth and the street taketh away
Where there's no blind justice, no way

Hey man, don't you understand, you can run but you can't hide
There ain't no life after death, so save your breath (you're gonna)
Be a rock 'n roll suicide
Hey man, do you need a hand, but I ain't no blessing in disguise

Feel the agony, and the ecstacy, it's gonna burn right through ya

[chorus]

Life's too short, so help yourself, 'cause I don't walk on water

[chorus]

'Cause the street giveth and the street taketh away [repeats out]
