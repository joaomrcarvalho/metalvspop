Pain!
Buried so far away
Enter my life of nothing

Sick of the same ol' thing,
so I dig a hole, bury, pain!
Sick of the same ol' thing,
so I dig a hole, bury, pain!

I am so high, always
Burying my life so slowly

[chorus]

It opens my mind to feelings
Can't face bottom without something

[chorus]

It opens my mind to feelings
Can't face bottom without something

[chorus]

We enter in my head
Feeling like I'm God
With the world around me
Can't you feel this pain!
reaming through my heart!
screaming through my veins!
nothing I can kill!
screaming a lie! I! Am!
Can't you feel my eyes out
Can't you take my heart. . . away
To heart
Good-bye

[chorus]
