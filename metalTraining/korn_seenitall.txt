I'm an animal
I'm a victim
I'm the answer to your prayers
I'm a witness
On the witchhunt
I'm the monster up the stairs
I'm ghost that's
In the mirror
I'm everything that you fear
I'm the riptide
I'm the soul-shock
I'm the voice that's in your head

[Chorus]
I've seen it all
Still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall
That brought me to my knees
I've done it all
Fucked up
Wasted
Still in my blood
But now inside unseen

I'm the hunted
I'm a predator
I'm the answer to the riddle
I'm the upbeat
I'm the headfuck
I'm the way yarn flips to the middle
I'm the player
I'm naive
I'm the one who's not addicted
I'm the logic
To the fuck up
I'm the broken one who fixed it

[Chorus X2]

I'm just a child
With the tears in it's eyes
I am holding this gift
That is broken
What do I have left now

I've seen it all
I've done it all
I've seen it all
I've done it all

[Chorus X2]

Now inside unseen
