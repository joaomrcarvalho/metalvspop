Little girl sleeping in dreams of peace
Mommy been gone a long time
Daddy comes home and she still sleeps
Waiting for the world worst crime
And he comes up the stairs like he always does

And he never turns on the light
And she's wide awake, scared to death
She smells his lust and she smells his sweat
Curled in a ball she holds her breath

Praying to a God that she's never met
Don't let Daddy kiss me, don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight

Little girl lies by her Daddy's side
And she listens to him breathe
She knows there's something awful wrong
That she's far too young to see

And she knows she can't tell anyone
She's too full of guilt and shame
And if she tells she'll be all alone
They'd steal her Daddy and they'd steal her home

And it's not so bad when Daddy leaves her alone
Praying to her God with his heart of stone
Don't let Daddy kiss me, don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight

Why, tell me why,
The worst crime, in the world

And so Daddy lies by his daughter's side
And he sleeps deep and well
No nightmares come to him tonight
Though his daughter lives in hell

For his seed is sown where it should not be
But the beast in his mind don't care
And the only sound are tears that fell
Little girl turns her face to the wall

She knows that no-one hears her call
But it seems that God hears nothing at all
Don't let Daddy kiss me, don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight
