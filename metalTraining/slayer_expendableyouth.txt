[King/Araya]

Gun down cold on a raw deal
Home turf my battlefield
In no one's way caught in a crossfire
Stray bullets can kill

[CHORUS]
Expendable youths
Fighting for possession
Having control the principle obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death the only solution

Inured soul lies on the ground
Head blown off face down
Lying in a pool of blood
An accidental death homicide

[CHORUS]

Struggling to survive
The drug induced warfare
To have control and principle obsession
Expendable youth fighting for possession
Violence is only a friend

[CHORUS]
