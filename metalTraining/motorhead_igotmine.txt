Here's the story, there's only me
No other place for you to be
It's only you babe, it's only you
I can't believe the things you do
Right now, right here
Ain't gonna let you disappear
Right now, this time, you got yours and I got mine

Come on baby, go back to start
I got your picture in my heart
It's only me babe, it's only me
Refuse, disposal, refugee
Rock'n'Roll you just might be my new career
Rock'n'Roll you just might be my new career

Come on baby, come on with me
You got me fallin out my tree
Be my lover, the number one
Be my friend but don't be gone
Nobody gonna interfere
