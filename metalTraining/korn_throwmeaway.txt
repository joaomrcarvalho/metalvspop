Flesh wound, flesh wound
With medication it will fade
Should I assume
That someone hears me when I pray?

Love, full of hate
Don't you love how I break?

[Chorus]
Don't let them throw me away
Keep me and I'll be okay
Skipping a beat but it plays
Don't let them throw me away
Don't let them throw me away

Screwed up, used up
Crumpled, lying on the floor
Fucked up, shut up
All you did back then was score

I'm feeling weak
Missing parts, incomplete

[Chorus]

Hold me up into the light
Fix the cracks and fix them right
Keep the pieces in the drawer
Keep them there forever more
May come in use for some day
Recycle this shit in some way
And all that I have to say
Don't let them throw me away

[Chorus]
