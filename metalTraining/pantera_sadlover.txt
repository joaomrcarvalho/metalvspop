Alright
Yeah
Whoa
if you want love
don't come to me
i'll be the last to give you sympathy
i've got my ways
under the covers
i'll be the last to be your back door lover
don't you cry now
not around me
baby i don't need that kinda company

sad lover
Queen of hearts misery
sad lover
you just ain't what i need

You got your ways
and i've got mine
i tell the truth
but you're out there lyin'
face it girl
white ain't black
this time it's over
don't come back

*?something?* as the years go by
don't be a ghost when you finally die.

Sad lover
Queen of hearts misery
Sad lover
you just ain't what i need

sad lover
queen of hearts misery
sad lover
you just ain't what i need
sad lover
queen of hearts misery
sad lover
you just ain't what i need
