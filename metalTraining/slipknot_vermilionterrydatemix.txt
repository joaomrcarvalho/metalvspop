She seems dressed in all the rings 
Of past fatalities 
So fragile yet so devious 
She continues to see
Climatic hands that press 
Her temples and my chest 
Enter the night that she came home (Forever) 

Oh (She’s the only one that makes me sad) 

She is everything and more
The solemn hypnotic
My Dahlia bathed in possession 
She is home to me 
I get nervous, perverse
When I see her, it’s worse
But the stress is astounding
It's now or never
She’s coming home (Forever)

Oh (She’s the only one that makes me sad)

Hard to say what caught my attention 
Fixed and crazy
Aphid attraction
Carve my name in my face
To recognise
Such a pheromone cult
To terrorize
I won’t let this build up inside of me
I won’t let this build up inside of me
I won’t let this build up inside of me
I won’t let this build up inside of me

Yeah!

Oh, I'm a slave and
I am a master 
No restraints and
Unchecked collectors 
I exist through my need
To self-oblige
She is something in me
That I despise
I won’t let this build up inside of me
I won’t let this build up inside of me
I won’t let this build up inside of me
I won’t let this build up inside of me
I won’t let this build up inside of me
I won’t let this build up inside of me
I won’t let this build up inside of me
I won’t let this build up inside of me

She isn’t real!
I can’t make her real!

She isn’t real!
I can’t make her real!

(She isn’t real, I can’t make her real)
(She isn’t real, I can’t make her real)
