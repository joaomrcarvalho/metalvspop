Even if you run... I will find you 
I decided I wanted you 
Now I know...I need 
If you can't be bought, tougher than I thought 
Keep in mind - I am with you 
Never left out fate, can't concentrate 

You will be mine! 
Ah, fucking you will be mine! 
Ah, fucking you will be mine! 
Ah, fucking you will be mine! 

I found you 

Leanin' out of an open window 
You laughed (my fingers clenched) 
Too perfect, far too careless 
I couldn't help myself - I just took you 

Dammit man I knew it was a mistake 
(You brought it outta me) 

Better make yourself out home 
You're here to stay 
You won't bother me...If you let me bother you 
All the doors are locked, all the windows shut 
Keep in mind - I watch you 
Never leave my side, never leave me, fucker 
Even if you run 

What the fuck is different? Man, I can't believe I'm doin' this 

Dammit man I knew it was a mistake 
(You brought it outta me)
