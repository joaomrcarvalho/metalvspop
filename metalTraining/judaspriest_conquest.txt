The night of reckoning
The days of old
His might is menacing
Sword and shield made of gold

Conquest and fire
The age of desire
When man will be free once more
Like rays from the sun
That heal everyone
Living for evermore

Bow down in reverence
Keep faith be true
Give thans for armistice
Be brave he'll come through

Sword and shield of gold
The mighty stand alone

Conquest and fire
The age of desire
When man will be free once more
Like rays from the sun
That heal everyone
Living for evermore

Conquest and fire
We will be strong
Days of desire
Making us stronger

Revenge and reckoning
Beware of this god
His might is menacing
Shield made of gold

Conquest and fire
The age of desire
When man will be free once more
Like rays from the sun
That heal everyone
Living for evermore

Conquest and fire
We will be strong
Days of desire
Making us stronger

Conquest attest
Stands triumphant
Heaven sent - be vigilant
Don't relinquish
