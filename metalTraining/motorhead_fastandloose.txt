Two o' clock in the morning baby,
I know it's late, I know it's late,
I'm dark and I like the night,
And I can make you feel alright,
I've been around for quite a while,
And I've learned to make you smile,
I know you won't refuse,
You know I'm Fast And Loose

Two o' clock in the morning sugar,
You know I'm sleeping, you must be sleeping,
Why don't you invite me in?
Get yourself some original sin,
I'll wake you up, but stay in bed,
Don't get up, get down instead,
I don't need no excuse,
To like it Fast And Loose

Two o' clock in the morning honey,
Let me in baby, let me in,
You know me, you know I'm wired,
I'm gonna stop you feeling tired,
I'm coming over and I won't be long,
Just let me finish writing this song,
I'm gonna blow your fuse,
I know you like it Fast And Loose
