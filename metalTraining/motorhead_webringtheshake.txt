We bear your names, we come to you
We own the game we run to you
We bring the blazing sun to you
We bring the blazing gun to you

We are your children grown and strange
We are your children unashamed
You breed contempt we mock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now

We bring the shake, we bring the shake
We say these things to shock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now

We climbed into the mean machine
We saw the ad, we bought the dream
We rather victims of neglect
We will not be what you expect
We are your children, strange and weird
We are your children, free and clear
You breed contempt we mock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now

We bring the shake, All hearts to break
We bring these words to mock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now
We bring the shake, All hearts to break
We bring these words to mock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now

The only thing that I regret
I didn't take what I could get
You owe us much, you owe us life
We owe you nothing eat the knife

We are your children chosen few
We are your children come for you
We bring the world to shock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now

We bring the shake, for goodness' sake
We bring the truth to mock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now
[repeat once]
We bring the shake, we bring the shake
We bring the shake to shock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now
