[Chorus:]
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger!
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga    
Yo, I FUCK yo' ass up!

To the young youth, ya wanna get gun? Shoot!
BLAOW! How you like me now? Don't fuck the style
Ruthless wild!

Wanna get on it like that, well then shout!

Lasers and blazers
Hit me with the major

You could never capture the Method Man's stature
For rhyme and for rapture, got niggaz resigning, now master

Let's get together

(Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buckwild with the tri-BLAOW!)

Brought like 20 white boys
in the back of a pick-up truck
with hockey pucks and skateboards
on their way to Woodstock
Leave home the glock
I have a gun the size of a blackhole
Shoot planets
Don't get credit
Throw your hands up in the air
Don't panic
Supreme arm leg leg arm head
Wu-Tang-Clan playin' the tightest long dreads.

[Chorus:]

(Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger!
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
I'll FUCK YOUR ASS UP!)

I come with that ol' loco
Style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bi-focals
I'm no joker! Play me as a joker
Be on you like a house on fire! Smoke ya!
Crews be actin like they gangs, anyway
Be like, "Warriors! Come out and playiyay!"
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once, but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit stinks in my drawers
So I can get fzza-funky for yah
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang RAHH!
Here comes the Tiger verse Crane!
Ow, be like wild with my style
Punk! You playing me, chump, you get DUMPED
