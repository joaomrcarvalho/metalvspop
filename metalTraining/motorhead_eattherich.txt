They say music is the food of love,
Let's see if you are hungry enough,
Take a bite, take another, just like a good boy would,
Get a sweet thing on the side,
Home cooking, homicide,
Side order, could be your daughter,
Fingerlicking good

Come on baby, eat the rich,
Put the bite on the son of a bitch,
Don't mess around, don't give me no switch,
C'mon baby eat the rich
C'mon baby eat the rich

Sittin' here in a restaurant,
Tell the waiter just what you want
Is that the meat, you wanted to eat,
How would you ever know?
Hash browns an' bacon strips,
I love the way that you lick your lips,
No fooling, I can see you drooling,
Feel the hunger grow

[Chorus]

Eat up, eat you, eat me,
Eat two, get one free
Shetland pony, extra pepperoni
Just pick up the phone,
Eat greek, or eat chinese,
Eat salad, or scarf up grease
You're on the shelf, maybe eat yourself,
Come on, bite my bone

[Chorus]
