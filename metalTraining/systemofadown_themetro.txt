I'm alone
Sitting with my broken glass
My four walls
Follow me through my past 
I was on a Paris train 
I emerged in London rain 
And you were waiting there
Swimming through apologies

I remember searching for the perfect words 
I was hoping you might change your mind 
I remember a soldier standing next to me 
Riding on The Metro 

I was smiling as you took my hand
Saw the moon
We spoke in France
You were passed the shallow words 
Years have passed and still the hurt 
You were passed the shallow words
Years have passed and still the hurt 
I can see you now 
Smiling as I pulled away
Sorry

I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand 
"I'll love you always" filled my eyes 
I remember the night we walked along the Seine
Riding on The Metro

I remember a feeling coming over me 
Then the soldier turned and walked away
Fuck you for loving me 
Riding on The Metro 

ahhh
