What's your lie? 

Warm lips, a fake smile, has made your mind runs wild, 
this game you play I like the way 
You expect to grab a child, you think I'm innocent, 
not wild, take me and look see how much I'm tame 

Never gotta a little, but I think he'll never know, 
how to live with sure body wild until the pressure so, 
I'll show you feelings that you pain is nothing, 
so let your body hang in there, what a frustrating fear 

Warm lips, a big smile, hatred runs through your insides, 
this game you play intimidation each day
You think it's all a lie, they want you to stray outta line, 
anger twisted your life, but you pay 

I wish I could take control, 
I wish I could let go, 
I wish I could break this mold, 
inside I'm so fucking cold 

I'm come'n 
I'm come'n 
I'm come'n on you

Never gotta a little, but I think he'll never know, 
how to live with sure body wild until the pressure so, 
I'll show you feelings, pleasure pain, is no control
so let your body hang in there, what a frustrating fear

I wish I could lose control,
I wish I could let go, 
I wish I could break this mold,
inside I'm so fucking cold 

Wet fits inside so the truth unfolds 
I learned to lybra suffering, 
This was real, I'm dead for you with heroin

What's come'n 
What's come'n 
What's come'n on you 

[x4]
I'm come'n 
I'm come'n, 
I'm come'n on you
