You always were too cool
Pushing us around school
Everyone knew who you were
You always walked the line
We had to step aside
We always had to eat your dirt

But the tables turned
And things have changed
Time for a lesson
So let's spell it out again
Remind me just in case
You might have forgotten
What's my name?
Say it again

You always brought us down
Kicked the weak around
Making out that we didn't exist
When we'd speak our views
You'd say 'who are you'
And make your point with a fist

But the tables turned
And things have changed
Time for a lesson
So let's spell it out again
Remind me just in case
You might have forgotten
What's my name?
Say it again
