Who is innocent?
No one is innocent?
Who is innocent?
Who is innocent?
No one is innocent?
Who is innocent?
Who is innocent?
Is it relevant in the world today?
I shake my head in disbelief
The killer walks again
Freed by evil men
And their dark charade
This can’t be happening
A mother’s selfish pride
Her child's homicide
Can she be to blame?
The suited vulture’s circling
A father’s cruelty
A murdered family
Is the world insane?
Their defenders ready to
Embrace their lies
With their devious smiles

Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You’ve been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You'll face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

Who is innocent?
No one is innocent
Who is innocent?
Presumed innocent
Justice fails again
In the masquerade
A battered woman trembling
Her lover drunk again
When will the torture end
In her web of shame?
Is death the only way?
A child victimized
The crime politicized
For the counselor's gain
The rabid media congregates
His tortured memories
A pervert's fantasies
Is the world insane?
The parasitic devastation seen
On your TV screen

Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You’ve been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You'll face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

False defender, burn forever
False defender, burn forever
Cold and spineless, have you no soul?
Wicked-minded, out of control
And guided by their hunger
They will find new ways to betray us

Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You’ve been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You'll face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

Who is innocent?
Is it relevant in the world today?
I shake my head in disbelief
Presumed innocent
Justice fails again
In the masquerade
Has the whole world become insane?
