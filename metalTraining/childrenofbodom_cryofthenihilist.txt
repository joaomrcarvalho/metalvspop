Don’t care have faith or mindset
Plunder and pillage yet
Complain whine and cry like a baby
Ain’t so tough after all
U claim that u don’t believe in nothing
Goddamn that must be exhausting
I know, you know this is getting
Boring, a lil dull, don’t u think?

And not to mention hatred, loath and revulsion
You just throw around, like it’s not even there

[Pre-chorus]
Embrassing dissolution
Is that who
I have become
Over the years?
Aversion to entity and
Life in this world
Broke you up in tears

When the nite comes, when the sunlite dies
That’s what it sounds like
When a nihilist cries

[Solo]

[Pre-chorus]

So it finally all got back to me
A real reactionary is what you’d like to be
When the nite comes, when the sunlite dies
That’s what it sounds like when a nihilist cries
