Recruiting the ill-fated for "The War"
A legion of uneducated, bankrupt souls
With a lust for revenge, answering the call
From New Yorqatar to Califarabia

Desperation provides fertile ground for religious extremism
This glorious brainwashing where prejudice lies
Like a crouching tiger
Tormenting peasants till they erect an army
Under everyone's nose
In the end propaganda destroys their DNA, God help them

[Solo - Drover]
[Solo - Mustaine]

All that they envisioned of what things would come to be
Turned into a pink mist when they blew to smithereens
We are just a war away from Amerikhastan
When God versus God;the undoing of man

Promising a vapor, in the end they become one

No rules of engagement, this enemy hides
Amongst women and children

And to beat violence, you must ignore the focus groups
You must send in the Mossad, turn of the BBC, CNN
And don't look back
Rest assured there'll be no more Middle Eastern crisis, hell!
There'll be no more Middle East!
These are your people Liberty
Pull up your dress today
And tattooed is "property of The USA
A subsidiary of Halliburton"
Surprise?!
But a roaring lion is about to be on earth
Hey, Jihad Joe? Guess what? We're coming to get you!

All that you envisioned of what things will come to be
Turns into a death knell when you look behind the scenes
We are just a war away from Amerikhastan
When God versus God, the undoing of man
