I’ve been dragged through mud here
Completely beat up and torn
But when last night comes back
To me I sure as hell know

We rocked, went crazy
And far beyond
When I look back
And ask myself
Was it worth it?

[Chorus]
Hell yeah
Ignore the pain
Hungover
But I’ll do it again
Crying
Tears made of grit
Flying
Oh yes, it was worth it

Yeah!!

Withdrawal kicking in, I can’t shake it
Yet in one way I have to take it

I’ll rock, go nuts
And far beyond
And I look back
I don’t need to know
Was it worth it?

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
