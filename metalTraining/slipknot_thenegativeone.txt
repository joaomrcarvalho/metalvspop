Fire and caffeine - a lot of nicotine
I'm going to burn so I better tell you everything
The competition - the superstition
Never mind 'cause you're never going to give in
It's a crisis, just how you like it
The same drama in a different disguise
I'm bound to walk with a target on my back
At least I'm ready for another attack

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me

Svengali - why are we the enemies?
I never follow and I never make apologies
Your dementias are gonna getcha
Because your walls can't support each other
Settle for the cynical - you're so political
You're getting ready 'cause the first move is critical
Reciprocity - somebody's listening
What did we learn from our time in captivity?

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me

I hope you live
To see the day
When your world goes up in flames
And as you die
You see my face
You're the only one to blame
(Fuck)

The prescient
The nascent
The quotient (They all will fall)
The cystic, symbolic, condition (Systemic)
Egregious, replete with
These lesions (Contaminate)
Succumb to the selfish
Creation (Your failure)

No accountability - divisibility
I point a finger but it's always looking back at me
The centipede's pulling on the mechanism
Unearthing scars of the cataclysm
When the innocent begin to circumvent 
The color fades, but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe? Does it matter now?
Turn away - the killer is disavowed

The lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me

I hope you live
To see the day
When your world goes up in flames
And as you die
You see my face
You're the only one to blame

The Lord of lies (The Lord of lies)
The morning star (The morning star)
You had to be set free
Opposing sides (Opposing sides)
Your choices are (Your choices are)
The negative one (The negative one)
The negative one (The negative one)
The negative one (The negative one)
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
And me
