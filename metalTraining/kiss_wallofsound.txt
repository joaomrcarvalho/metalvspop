The blood's getting hot
No matter what you've got
You can't stop the roll of the thunder (yeah)
You wanna take a shot
So give me all you've got
Can't break the spell that I'm under (no)

And the battle never ends
And the soldiers never die
And you don't back down
And you don't pretend when you look them in the eye

And it all comes down
To the wall of sound
Yeah, and it all comes down

When it all goes wrong
You've got to be strong
The rest of the world's going to shatter
It doesn't matter

Let the floods go raging by
Let the sinners wash away
To the dark of man there's a ray of light
There begins another day

And it all comes down
To the wall of sound (ooh)

Yeah!

And the battle never ends
And the soldiers never die
And you don't back down
And you pretend when you look them in the eye

Yeah!

And we all bow down
To the wall of sound
Yeah, we all bow down
To the wall of sound
Bow down
Yeah, bow down
Bow down
