I'm obnoxious and no one's home
In my head
In my head

Cardboard boxes filled with hate
In my head
They're in my head

Nest of termites, glowin' red
In my head
They're in my head

[chorus]
Look behind the mask
Try to find peace of mind
And you'll find
Just look behind the man
And lead me by the hand

Faded smiles behind dark shades
In my head
In my head

Plastic icons, glowin' red
In my head
They're in my head

I experiment with myself
In my head
In my head

Look behind the glass
Try to find peace of mind
And you'll find
Just look behind the man
And lead me
Aaaaahhhaaaaaahaaaa
Aaaaahhhaaaaaahaaaa

Look behind the glass
Try to find peace of mind
And you'll find
Just look behind the man
And lead me

Look behind the man
Look behind the glass
Look behind the mask
