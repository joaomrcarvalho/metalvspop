My love is like a cannonball,
I'm takin' aim and you're gonna fall
Don't hide or try to get away,
you know the rules and you're gonna play

[Chorus:]
And we go one, two, three, four,
when midnight comes, I'll be at your door
Five, six, seven, eight, oh, oh, I just can't wait
I'm gonna bang, bang you -
I'll shoot you down with my love gun, baby
Bang, bang you - I got you in the heart,
you're gonna be mine, yeah
Hands up, reach for the sky,
I'll treat you good, 'cause I'm a bad guy

If love's a crime I've got a hundred schemes
I'll be the villain in your book of dreams

[chorus]

(You know what I'm talking about. Ooh, come on!)

(Listen) - [chorus]

Bang, bang you, I'll shoot you down with my love gun, baby
Bang, bang you, I got you in the heart,
you're gonna be mine, yeah
