From the reign I've built
Of shame and guilt
I go back and take a look
At myself and what
I have done so far
At the bridge she's
Dying waiting till light

No choice to go
Backward, inwards
Okay, shatter us
You're to cross the chamber

Going down I walk my way till now
Deep to the obscurity
Obliterating you in every way
With my life's insanity

Battered up again
I'm going right insane
Curled up on the floor
Wonder ways to kill the pain and
What doesn't kill you
Only makes you pissed off

Sweep back to kill
You pray, make it go away
So let's, sweep back the shining blade
Cause when you punch me, I bleed

Going down I walk, my way till now
Deep to the obscurity
Obliterating you in every way
With my life's insanity
