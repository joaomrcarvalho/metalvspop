Rock'n'roll, save your soul
An' I got it
Give it to me, loud and free
Don't knock it
Let me hear 'til the end of time
It's  the only way
Send shivers up and down your spine
You can't stop it

[CHORUS]
I'm tellin' one more time
It ain't no crime
Rock it

It's the only way to fly
Gotta have it
Break thru gonna break you too
Better grab it
Let me hear it 'til the end of time
It's the only way
It'll stop you on a dime
Gotta have it

[CHORUS]

Rock'n'roll music gonna stop the world
Can't lose it
It'll make your toenails curl
Can't defuse it
Let me hear it all the time
It's  the only way
Gonna make ya feel alright
You can't excuse it

[CHORUS]
