Sunrise, wrong side of another day
Sky high, and six thousand miles away
Don't know how long I been awake
Wound up in an amazin' state
Can't get enough
And you know its righteous stuff
Goes up like prices at Christmas this-
Motorhead, you can call me
Motorhead, all right...

Brained out, total amnesia
Get some mental anaesthesia
Don't move, I'll shut the door and kill the lights
If I can be wrong, I must be right
All good clean fun
Have another stick of gum,
Man you look better already
Motorhead, remember me now
Motorhead, alright...

Fourth day, five day marathon,
We're moving like a parallelogram
Don't move, the morning's not a pretty sight
I guess I'll see you all on the ice
I should be tired and all I am is wired
ain't felt this good for an hour
Motorhead, remember me now,
Motorhead, all night...
