Dear diary, what have I done? Am I trippin' or am I alive?
Once I've decided I've got stories to tell
No way in hell was that just another muthafuckin' dream
Doesn't matter cuz I already know how it feels to WAKE UP WITH

Body like a roadmap of pain
Mind like a landfill of shame
Tie my rope one more time

Dear diary, had I known what I told you last night
I would've never walked there to start another fight
Banging my head on concrete wall, while knockin' on wood
Thinking it that's gonna do any good when I WAKE UP WITH

Body like a roadmap of pain
Mind like a landfill of shame
TIE MY ROPE

Tell me once, I decline, I refuse to learn
Shoot me twice but I'm not going down
I will climb the rope you tied for me
Beat me up while I'm still alive
