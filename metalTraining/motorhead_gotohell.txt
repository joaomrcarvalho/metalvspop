Ya told me that ya wanted it
I knew it wasn't true
Turned out to be the facts babe
You know what you can do
You can go to hell, you can go to hell
Goodbye for you

Wrapped around your little finger
Under you thumb too
You know that I'm a singer
I'm singin' just for you
You can go to hell etc.

I guess I betta get movin'
Lotta things I gotta do
I realize it was a waste of time
Talkin' sense to you
You can etc.

Hope ya got my little message
I hope you hear me
I thought ya might've been the answer
Obviously crazy
