Your lies that took me where I've been
Your lies don't make me who I am
Your lies that left me scarred
And so fucking hard
Your lies that burn me deep inside
Your lies that helped to bleed me dry
Left on your own
Because your cover's blown
I am, taking the music back
Against your will I'm not a slave
Against the deal and you ge paid
I won't throw you a rope
Against it, you're the enemy
Against it, your philosophy
Shit thrown against the wall
You'll eat it all
