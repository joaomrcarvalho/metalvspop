In The Year Of The Wolf,
all the world smelled good,
In the snow and the ice,
all the rest was blood,
In the time of the tribe,
we took a thousand lives,
When I ran with the wolves,
and the hunting was good,

See me now, I was another,
Not like me, when the wolves were brothers,
See me now, you cannot know,
The kind of food that me grow,

It was the wolf in me,
Body and soul on fire,
In the cold, full moon,
Blood, red, desire,
It was the wolf in me,
You know it felt so true,
The night I ran with the wolves,
Tonight I come for you,

In The Year Of The Wolf,
how could you ever know,
There in the forest,
I had teeth to show,
In a different time,
when the world was mine,
When I ran as a wolf,
and the sun burned low,

See me now, I was another,
Mean and vicious, fast and clever,
see me now, you would not dream,
The food I ate, the food that screamed,

It was the wolf in me,
And all my soul was fire,
By the cold, dull moon,
Blood, red, desire,
It was the wolf in me,
I howled the cold night through,
The year I ran as a wolf,
Tonight the food is you,

In The Year Of The Wolf,
all the tribe ran mad,
On the frozen lake,
and I felt so glad,
With tooth and claw,
all your blood and more,
When I ran with the wolves,
and the hunt turned bad,

See me now, this is not me,
Not like the one, I used to be,
See me now, you would not guess,
A different heart raving in my chest,

It was the wolf in me,
When the world was cold,
It was the life I lived,
In the dark world below,
It was the wolf in me,
Crying and howling too,
I was crying for the hunt,
But I was hunting for you
