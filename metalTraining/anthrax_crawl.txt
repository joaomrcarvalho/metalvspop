Sometimes I forget to see,
Now that I've found you
What is and what will never be
Now that I've found you
When my time has gone away
The words I say
Their lies will help you through
And I feel like it's gonna rain
A real rain
To wash this from you too

So addicted to the pain
And it's the pain that makes you crazy
Your mind is closing in
On a fight that you can't win
It's making me insane

If you crawl
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away

I think of all things that just got lost
Now that you found me
As if I just had shuffled off
Now that you found me
When my time had gone away
The actions played
They broke your world in two
And I feel like it's gonna rain
A real rain
To wash this from you too

So addicted to the pain
And it's the pain that makes you crazy
Your mind is closing in
On a fight that you can't win
It's making me insane

If you crawl
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away

Crawling, crawling, crawling, crawling
Crawling, crawling, crawling, crawling
What Is and what will never be
And it's the pain that makes you crazy

If you crawl
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you crawl
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away

Crawling...
What Is and what will never be
And it's the pain that makes you crazy
