I've written about my inner wars,
But i could give a shit about right now,
Most of me is all strength
And all of me is at war with dope
But my eyes are clear in sight
My guts are blazing,
I might have a life

I can't hide, to erase, what I've done-
Last year, and three years before
It still takes assholes of all kinds
On that fact I am still clear,
(cause) I should know and now I do
I'm one of them
I'm just like you
I'm just like you
A man that stands his ground with strength

Last year, and years before
Can't hide myself
I won't try
It makes me strong
It makes me strong
It makes me strong

It blows away weakness
It blows away detachment
It blows away the depression inside
It blows away the mental withdrawal
It blows that shit away
