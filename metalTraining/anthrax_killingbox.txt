I have always been an experiment in terror
At least I can only kill you once
Standing aloof when I made up my mind
Reaching, reaching, why it's better to be blunt

Your walking point through my minefield
You gotta get out (get out)
Your on point in my minefield
Forever waiting for a roadmap

Speak

Answer me

I left you in a killing box
I left you in a killing box
I left you in a killing box
I left you in a killing box

Sketchy's not a name you can pin on me
I'll start a revolt with my honesty
A piece of you burns every time you lie
So let's start a war, just to see how many die

Your walking point through my minefield
You gotta get out (get out)
Your on point in my minefield
Forever waiting for a roadmap
