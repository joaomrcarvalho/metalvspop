She lay as though she were in a trance, 
With her long eyelashes fluttering like she was dreaming. 
She said to him "I lie beyond the sea", 
And then all of a sudden her head dipped back and she vanished. 

Gone, gone without a trace. 
Gone. 

She's never coming back, do you know what it's like to live with that? 
No one knows what it's like. 
The only one who knew me, gone."
