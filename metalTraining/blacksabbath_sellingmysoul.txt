Man of madness
Who lives in my head
Keeping me awake at night, he sits on my bed
He drives me crazy he won't go away
Playing his game every night and every day
Yeah

My mind feels heavy
My body feels weak
Suicidal thoughts crying out for some sleep
Impending doom is what I'm about
Think I'm going out without a shadow of doubt

I search for serenity yeah
Is it really out there?
I don't read the holy books cause
They take me no where
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control
I'm paying the price now for
Selling my soul, selling my soul

I search for serenity, yeah
Is it really out there?
I don't read the holy books cause
They take me no where
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control
I'm paying the price now for
Selling my soul, selling my soul

Yeah, selling my soul
Yeah, selling my soul
Yeah, for selling my soul
