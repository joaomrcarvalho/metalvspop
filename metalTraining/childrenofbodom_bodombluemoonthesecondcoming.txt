Ah!

I was a man, that I, seldom long.
She had a bond to make, to form with you.
He wanted to gently stroke your hair.
Its the coming one, the son and the heir.

Lay down, close your eyes if you dare..
Before you know you might be down.

You procreate my next reign!
What did you expect to see?
In the water to end, we drown.
You might as well cause we are already going down!

Never look beyond this, scurry away.
Say a month to wait, any old day.
And the Reaper won't cut you any slack,
You better take a run and don't look back!

Its all the same, which way to go?
The body of lake Bodom will come to you!
The waters so cold we drown,
It might as well cause we are already going down!

Raise your hammered face,
You're praying once more,
Trying to survive... 
But you're at death's door.
Run, which way is safe?
You can't turn back.
Sleep or wait it out,
Until the next attack!
