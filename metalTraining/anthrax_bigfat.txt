Looming large like a favorite son
One more time comes my obsession
Like a mountain stream that ends in mud
I'm wading in shit waiting for the flood
Sinking

You did, you did, you did, you did
Left me hating
You did, you did, you did, you did
Contemplating

I'm drinking strength for comic relief
While I'm growing super weak in the knees
You asked me can I deliver
Like a monster crossing the Hudson River
Stomping

You did, you did, you did, you did
Left me waning
You did, you did, you did, you did
Slowly draining
Feet of clay that are stuck to the floor
You did, you did, you did, you did
And with vanity you want more

Big fat kill
Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
In my hands
Carrying the weight of the world

I'm biting my tongue so much it hurts
But at the same time I'm at a loss for words
The things I've seen should've left me blind
So it makes me happy that I'm losing my mind
Laughing

Big fat kill
Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
In my hands
Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
In my hands
Carrying the weight of the world

Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
In my hands
Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
Carrying the weight of the world
In my hands
Carrying the weight of the world

You asked me can I deliver

In my hands
