Working the room with her cat clothes on,
Messing up my mind
Mouth just made for kissing
Says a good man's hard to find,
I'm just hangin' standin' there,
Can't believe my eyes,
She looks so fine and she smiles so kind,
Make a strong man cry.

She does me in, and she'll do you too.
She only got to shake it,
And I'm shaking in my shoes

[CHORUS]
You know she's a natural woman
You know she likes that fine
You know she's a total killer,
And she ain't even trying
I want her so bad I get shivers
If I can't see her enough
She asked me my name, I said "Honey,
My name is Doctor Love"

Sat down by me and I told her
She's like to drive me blind
She smiled like a hungry tiger
Said a hard mans good to find
I just stood there helpless,
Wondering what I should move,
She said "Come on honey, show me your money
Ain't got no time to lose".

She does me in, and she'll do you to
She only has to shake it,
And she shakes me in my shoes.
You know she's a lovely lady
She ain't no easy girl
She make me wanna love her long time
To make her toenails curl.

I want her so bad I get crazy
If she don't love me enough
I want to examine her stamina
'Cos my name is Doctor Love.

She got no human pity
She don't care who she hurts
The face of an evil angel
Says a hard man makes her worse
I want to drive her crazy
Get her in her in between
But she makes it awful hard
If you see what I mean
She does me in, and she'll do you too
She only got to shake it
And I'm shaking in my shoes

You know she's a classic beauty
She don't want to fight
She like a man who's standing tall
And stood up all right
I want her so bad I get crazy
If she don't call me up
She said, "Honey, do you want me to call you?"
I said "Just call me Doctor Love"
