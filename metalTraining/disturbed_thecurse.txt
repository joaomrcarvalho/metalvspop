Marked for demolition, I'm
Just a time bomb ticking inside
No hope for the hopeless,
I can see the pieces all laid out in front of me

No point even asking why
Couldn't help even if you tried
Step aside or you might just be the next contestant
To feel the Brutality!

Devastation, Obliteration
Are all to the point of Exacerbation
There's no explaining my situation now,
Why does this shit keep happening to me?

I've held on too long just to let it go now,
Will my inner strength get me through it some how
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!

Too dark for forgiveness, I
Can't seem to do anything right
When I try to rebuild I see my humble shelter
Just fall to the ground again

Object to the evil eye
No point to let anyone try
Take heed my friend lest you be torn asunder
Like all that's become of me

Descimation, Disintegration
Now beyond the point of imagination,
There's no explaining my situation now
Why does this shit keep happening to me?

I've held on too long just to let it go now,
Will my inner strength get me through it some how
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!

I've held on too long just to let it go now, (Will my inner strength)
Will my inner strength get me through it some how (Defying the curse)
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!
