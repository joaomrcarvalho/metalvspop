Pushin' the law again
Pushin' the law again

Justice with a sword
Our smiling knight on board
Opening his heart to everyone
And loving without a doubt
Embracing friends and
Embarrassing foes,
And those who were unjust
A man true to his heart
Without fear or misgivings
With "insecurity" tattooed
Across his body
The first to accept, the last to disappoint
He understood all and expected nothing

Now you are free
Free to roam in the skies
Now and then visit me
With your starlit eyes
You took all our hearts
With your smile,
And left a legacy untold
You conquered life and fear,
So you see there was no room for you to grow old
