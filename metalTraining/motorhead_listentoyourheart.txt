Here we are, about to blow a fuse
Hold it down, 'cause if you move you lose
Give me time, I need to make mistakes
Give me love, before my poor heart breaks

Listen to your heart, Listen all your life
Listen to your hear, and then you'll be alright
Don't you see, the truth is always close
Eyes are wide, just like you seen a ghost
Give me hope, 'cause I was never sure
Give me faith, 'cause I was never yours

Listen to your heart, Listen all your life
Look into my eyes, before you say good-bye
Raise your hand, if you deserve the blame
If you can, them you won't die ashamed
Give me strength, so I can make a stand
Give me light, so I can show my hand
Look me in the eyes
Before we say good-bye
Tell me the truth or die
and then you'll be alright
