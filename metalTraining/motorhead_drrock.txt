All right, all right
I hope you son of bitches see the light
You again, you again
I know you've got a mental age of ten
Listen up, listen up
I wouldn't swap you for a thousand bucks
Come on, you're the one
I think I'm going to switch your lazer on

[Chorus]
I've got the medicine you need
I've got the power, I've got the speed
I'll find out how to stop your clock
We sure ain't talking Doctor Spock
Hear me talking, Doctor Rock.

Lay down, turn around
Here come the sister gonna strip you down
Shut up, breathe in
Lets have the address of your next of kin
Chin up, shoulders back
You've got a body like a Marshall stack
Keep still, take your pill
Or I'm gonna make you really ill.

[Chorus]

Next please, next please
Try to separate those cowardly knees
X-ray, you've gotta pay
The only chance you've ever got of getting away
Here we are, what's the scar
I don't like anything I've seen so far
Pay me, pay me
I ain't no doctor of philosophy

[Chorus]
