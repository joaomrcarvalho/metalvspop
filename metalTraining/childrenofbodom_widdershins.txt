The path I walked is now 
covered in dust of contrition
as you say I've lost my way 
The nights getting clouded over
I hear the echo of your call
Sweet words softly weaving
My eyes are open and bleeding

One way or another
Has never been the right direction
Our sky or another
Could be on reflection
I'm looking up if the stars sign
The afterlife that is to be mine
And wonder if you let them shine

Alive or dead, but not dead yet
Widdershins and hence we fly
The left hand path
Attract a wicked mind

Backwards we walk thru
The maze of life we spent
A new beginning could be the end
I'm lookin' up and the stars sign
Our afterlife that you are to be mine
Don't wonder just let them shine

Widdershins and hence we fly
The left hand path
Attract a wicked mind

Alive or dead, but not dead yet
You dance around me
Widdershins and the two tormented souls met
