Far off in the distance, a shape in the night, alright
On a mission of mercy, if the price is right
He tries to possess her and she bites

It's a ritual slaying, but the tables are turned, oh no
And now he's prayin', but it's his turn to burn
Like a thief in the night - she breaks into his heart
Like a thief in the night - she never leaves her mark
In a hotel chamber, on a cryptic note
'Cos where there's fire, there's gotta be smoke, oh no
Footsteps in the twilight, and red nails 'round his throat

It's a ritual slaying, without strings attached, oh no
And now he's praying, but there's no turning back
Like a thief in the night - she breaks into his heart
Like a thief in the night

Like a thief in the night - she never leaves her mark
Like a thief in the night - alright, alright
Like a thief in the night - reaks into his heart
Like a thief in the night - alright, alright
Like a thief in the night - she never leaves her mark
Like a thief in the night
