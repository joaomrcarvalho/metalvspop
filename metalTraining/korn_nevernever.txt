I'll never love again...

I won't ever have to pretend...

I'm never gonna love again...

[Verse 1:]
I don't ever wanna have to try.
Though I lie, It never flies.
I don't ever wanna have to die.
But deep inside, The death it hides.
And I never wanna clarify and justify so I run and hide.
And I never wanna signify so I pacify all the hate inside.

[Chorus:]
(No)
I'll never love again.
(No)
I won't ever have to pretend.
(No)
I'm never gonna love again.
Never gonna have to try to pretend.
Never, never, never.

[Verse 2:]
I don't ever wanna satisfy, 
'Cause things inside are doing fine.
I don't ever want to multiply,
'Cause deep inside I'm not qualified.
And I never wanna clarify and justify so I run and hide.
And I never wanna signify so I pacify all the hate inside.

[Chorus:]
(No)
I'll never love again.
(No)
I won't ever have to pretend.
(No)
I'm never gonna love again.
Never gonna have to try to pretend.
Never, never, never.

I'll never love again...

I'm never gonna love again...

Never, never...

[Chorus:]
(No)
I'll never love again.
(No)
I won't ever have to pretend.
(No)
I'm never gonna love again.
Never gonna have to try to pretend.
Never, never, never.
(No)
Never, never, never.
(No)
Never, never, never.
(No)
I'm never gonna love again.
Never gonna have to try to pretend.
Never, never, never.
