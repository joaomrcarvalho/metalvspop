God save the queen
The fascist regime
They made you a moron
Potential H-bomb

God save the queen
She ain't no human being
There is no future
In England's dreaming

Don't be told what you want
Don't be told what you need
There's no future, no future
No future for you

God save the queen
We mean it man
We love our queen
God saves

God save the queen
Cuz tourists are money
Our figure head
Is not what she seems

Oh god save history
God save your mad parade
Oh lord god have mercy
All crimes are paid

When there's no future
How can there be sin
We're the flowers in the dustbin
We're the poison in your human machine
We're the future, your future

God save the queen
We mean it man
We love our queen
God saves

God save the queen
We mean it man
And there is no future
In England's dreaming

No future, no future
No future for you
No future, no future
No future, no future for me

No future, no future
No future for you
No future, no future for you
