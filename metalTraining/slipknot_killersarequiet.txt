Cycle of life and death supposedly 
goes 'round and 'round yet it stops with me 
Glorious hunter of my faith I have sinned 
Killers are quiet like the the breath of the wind 

Filling the shadows with forms of my own 
Raised by kindred of Get I was born 
Abomination world in disarray 
Killers are quiet when they seek the vitae 

Reflection beckons a portal shard 
Spiritual quest I must stay in guard 
Stepping sideways betweens worlds I shift 
Killers are quiet when they are born with the gift 

Beautiful Anguish cast out by my race 
Now one that's Ageless I save my own face 
I write my own laws with Death I break bread 
Killers are quiet when they come from my head
