Woah yeow

They try kicking and screaming as loud
Contation break us apart
Will not control us they won't hold you down
I'm sorry, that's my knife in you!
Another day of falling down your way
Pushing and screaming cause
They thought it might be right

Hey

Take my hand and fly
Will you ever be that tall
Don't you be afraid
We're not gonna fall

Did you think
I'd let you mix it up
Give me a reason bitch
You're gonna fuck it up

Hey

Take my hand and fly
Will you ever be that tall
Don't you be afraid
We're not gonna fall

Hey

Do you believe in what we've got
Try it, take your one shot
We stand once and for all
We're not gonna fall

[Solo]

Well you thought you had the authority
To slay and kill the minority
Together we stand tall
Not gonna crash, not gonna fall

Did you think I'd let you mix it up
Give me a reason bitch
I'm gonna fuck you up
It's real, into the charge

At the end we're standing up
