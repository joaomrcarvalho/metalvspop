I know deep inside of me
There's a place but it's not plain to see
Where I belong, where no one else can be

I'm searching for myself again
And here I'm all alone and when
I close my eyes, no one else can see

I Walk Alone, can't you see?
I don't belong, let me be.
Everything that I dreamed of being is me

And I got myself to lean on
Got both my feet on the ground

You don't know me, I don't know me
I can't see you, you can't see me
Close my eyes, leave the world behind

So I got no heart, I got no home
I got no somewhere I belong
I don't worry, everything's just fine

I Walk Alone, can't you see?
I don't belong, let me be
Everything I dreamed of being...

And I don't belong, can't you see?
I Walk Alone, let me be
Everything that I dreamed of being is me

And I got myself to lean on
I got both my feet on the ground

[Solo 1]

So I got no hearth, and I got no home
And I got no somewhere I belong
I don't worry, everything's just

[Solo 2]

I got myself to lean on
I got both my feet on the ground

And I got myself to lean on
And I got both my feet on the ground

[Chorus:]
Girl, I know deep inside of me
There's a place but it's not plain to see
Where I belong, where no one else can be

And I'm searchin' for myself again
And here I'm all alone is when
I close my eyes, and no one else can see

[Solo 3]
