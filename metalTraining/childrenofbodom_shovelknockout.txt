Hundred killers after you
What the hell you gonna do?
Think they’re gonna kick your ass
Bring you down, make you crash

I never thought the tables
Would turn like this
That one day on your grave
I’m gonna spit and piss

C’mon, you fucker, let’s go
By this time you already know
With that standpoint of hias
You can kiss my Nordic pale white ass!

I’m a raw loose cannon til the end
To the depths of hell you
I will send

[Chorus]
I don’t think anyone ever liked me
And I don’t give a fuck
Would you really think I ever dug you
Hit me with a shovel if I do

[Solo]

[Chorus]
