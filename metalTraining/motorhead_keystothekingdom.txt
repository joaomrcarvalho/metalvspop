Death in the stars, rain on the wind,
Came to the mission, couldn't get in,
Came out of nowhere, guess I'll go back,
All down to bad luck,
Fire in the sky, nowhere to run,
Came to the desert, burned by the sun,
Came out of somewhere, I ain't never been back,
All down to bad luck,

King of frustration, Vampire de Luxe,
Keys To The Kingdom, God hates your guts,
Out of the heavens a blessing might fall,
But the Keys To The Kingdom mean nothing at all,

Crippled by cold, blinded by fear,
Looking for God, but they said he ain't here,
Came out of nowhere, can't stand to go back,
All down to bad luck,
Carved on a stone, the world's epitaph,
Walked through te graveyard, just had to laugh,
Came out of exile, for a handful of dust,
All down to bad luck,

King aggrivation, Vampire de Luxe,
Congratulations, God hates your guts,
Bound for damnation, backs to the wall,
And the Keys To The Kingdom mean nothing at all,

High in the sky, in letters of fire,
The names of the saints, the thieves and the liars,
Came to the funeral, out of pure spite,
All down to bad luck,
The least we could do, the harder we tried,
The better we lived, the sooner we died,
Came to the goldmine, cold and alone,
All down to bad luck,

King of starvation, Vampire de Luxe,
Keys To The Kingdom, we hate your guts,
In the asylum, no one hears you call,
And the Keys To The Kingdom mean nothing at all,
Nothing at all
