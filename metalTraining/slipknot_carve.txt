I salt my wounds,
Then lick 'em clean
A cloud of dust,
Then I'm gone 
Always dealing with that and this 
I released then I believe 
64 elimination 
We'll make you understand, 
How we feel, 
Facsination, 
I need a gun, 
I need a gun to carve

Your pain I see, 

Carve! There's something inside! 
Carve! There's nothing inside! 
Carve! There's something inside! 
Carve! It's not done till over 
Carve! There's something inside! 
Carve! There's nothing inside! 
Carve! There's something inside! 
Carve!

You're in your place trapped, 
You're gonna get your face slapped, 
Bring more, 
Slice, dice and penalize, 
Gonna getted slam dunk, 
You fat ass punk, 
You stick your own face, 
Yet you can't afford your own place, 
I am gonna give you a little more, 
Gonna make you wanna to take it, 
Thank you anyways, 
I am just taking you, 

Roll your ass, 
Force you to pass, 
Least I am not fucked, 
Whatcha going to do, 
When God sees through you, 
(You are fake) 
You want it even louder, 
Eyes and ears, 
Listen to what we say, 
So there is no way to eliminate, 
(I want it all!!!!) 
I am going to show you how to be decieving,
