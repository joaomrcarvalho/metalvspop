LOUIE, LOUIE
I gotta go
LOUIE, LOUIE
Me gotta go

A fine little girl, she wait for me
Me catch the ship across the sea
I sailed the ship all alone
I never think I'll make it home.

LOUIE, LOUIE
I gotta go
LOUIE, LOUIE
Me gotta go

Three nights and days we sailed the sea
Me think of girl constantly
On the ship I dream she there
I smell the rose in her hair.

LOUIE, LOUIE
I gotta go
LOUIE, LOUIE
Me gotta go

Me see Jamaica moon above
It won't be long me see me love
Me take her in my arms and then
I tell her I never leave again.

LOUIE, LOUIE
I gotta go
LOUIE, LOUIE
Me gotta go
