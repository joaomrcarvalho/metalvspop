Hardcase
Fist full of brass
Double barrelled pistons and a tank full of gas
He's a heavyweight
Enforcer inside
Like a man in the chair he's gonna go for a ride
Break him
Take him down
Squeeze him, watch him drown
Against lightning
The wind from his sails
Take on a man who's harder than a coffin nail
Priceless, the look on his face
If you look real close you can see the expiration date
Break him
Take him down
Squeeze him, watch him drown
Black Dahlia's in my head
Ice veined
Thousand yard stare
Breaking a man is like hunting for bear
And I'm loaded
Setting the trap
Tighten the noose
And bust a rat with my sap
Break him
Take him down
Squeeze him, watch him drown
Black Dahlia's in my head
Black Dahlia's in my head
Confession's good for the soul
Black Dahlia's in my head
In this hunt I walk alone
