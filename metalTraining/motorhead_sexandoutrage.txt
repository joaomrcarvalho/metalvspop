Seize the time
There's only minutes left to zero
Just got a little taste
I gotta get some more
Just me and you

[Chorus]
Teenage, backstage, sex and outrage

It's like I got
An outboard motor in my bloodstream
And all you've done tonight
Is walk in through the door
No lie - all true

Teenage, backstage, sex and outrage

I think you know
Exactly what I'm trying to get at
The way you move yourself
Should be against the law
It's up to you

Teenage, backstage, sex and outrage
