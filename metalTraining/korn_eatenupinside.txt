I'll die smiling,
Something the past
Someone said to me will,
Make me laugh,
And I'll lay back and fade away,

Let me go I'll be fine,
Frozen here in time,
Sick of being alive,

Eaten up inside

Let me die,
Go away,
I never got what I wanted,
I never got what I needed,
What's on my mind,
Who can say?
It's my invention I'm beating,
I can not stop all this bleeding,

I'll be ready,
Give me the morphine and I'll go to sleep,
As I dream maybe I will just slide away,

Let me go I'll be fine,
Frozen here in time,
Sick of being alive,

Eaten up inside,

Let me die,

Go away,
I never got what I wanted,
I never got what I needed,
Whats on my mind?
Who can say?
It's my infection I'm feeding,
I can not stop all this bleeding
