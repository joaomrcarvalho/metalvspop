You call for reason
it turns me inside out
there's no direction
no ebb and flow
you call them rejects
they're all I have
the mills of life
they will grind you down

See the red
all I know is
see the red
watch it flowing

I see a vision
chew it with my teeth
believe the dying
and minds that read
a change in season
your mind crawls back
turning neurotic
a self-attack

See the red
all I know is
see the red
watch it flow

This beast is vicious
turns your pale face green
and keep the search on for mystery
you told a secret
confide into the trees
thinking you know a man's history

See the red
all I know is
see the red
watch it flow

Fall into pieces, I swear we're done
you stick with me and prevail as one
