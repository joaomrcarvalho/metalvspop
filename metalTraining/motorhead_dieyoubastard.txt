You can smell the danger, watch your step
See the frienly stranger stretch your neck
Keep them in the dark, now, it's alright
You know they only come out at night

[CHORUS]
Your shadows alive, it breathes at your side
Got no place to hide, be with you 'til the day you die

You can hear the rumors, shut your mouth
Deal with the misfits, wipe 'em out
Search in all the bedrooms, use your head
Listen to your conscience, wake the dead

[CHORUS]

Mother kiss a vampire, shut  the door
Rats in all the  rooms, babe, hit the floor
I think it's a gamble, but what's your sign
Upway at the downside, stay  in line

[CHORUS OUT AND TITLE]
