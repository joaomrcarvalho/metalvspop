I see that nothin's changed
Insist on playing games
Some waste of time you are
And you're so popular
Well this is it you bitch
I got to make a switch
You find some other john
I know what's goin' on

Your move what do I have to lose
Stalemate, too late, too late

I thought you were for real
Just one more rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap
I just escaped your trap
You think you see the joke
But you're just chasin' smoke
'Cos now the thrill is gone
I know what's goin' on

[CHORUS]

Misunderstanding me
The way you felt so free
I'm gonna jump the gun
I'm gonna cut an' run
Your credibility
Don't cut no ice with me
You're just a feeble con
I know what's goin' on

[CHORUS]
