HIV!

Here I am different in this normal world
Why did you tease me? Made me feel upset
Walking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly. Please just go away

HIV!
I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
HIV!
Why do you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay (Made the hurt stay)

As I walk I can never seem to escape
All the laughing, all the pain
If you were me, what would you do?
Nothing, probably. You'd just throw your way...

Faget! [x2]

I'm just a pretty boy, whatever you call it
You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it
It keeps going on day after day, son
You faggot, if we don't want none
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way everyday
Who gives a fuck?!
Right now I got something to say to all the people that think
I'm strange and I should be out here locked up in a cage
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway
You got this pretty-boy feeling
Like I'm enslaved to a world that never
Appreciated shit
