Our star was out tonight
Our diamond shined so bright
I watched it go
Farther than he ever dreamed
I can't take it

No matter how I try
I can't stop asking why
'Cause something's broken
Scared it breaks my heart
I won't take it, can't break it

In the end
I'm pounding on the door
But It's already over
Too little, too late

In the end
He'll be my light in the dark
For when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me

And when the greatest falls
Heaven and Hell will call
Stand up and fight
On and on his memory screams
I can't take it

Stand up and fight withal
I won't take it, I can't break it

In the end
I'm pounding on the door
But It's already over
Too little, too late

In the end
They'll be my light in the dark
For when the sun goes down
For when the sun goes down

In the end
I'm kicking down the door
And I'm taking this over
I'm cleaning the slate

In the end
They'll be my light in the dark
For when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me

Did I thank you, for our time together?
Did I thank you, for making me better?
Did I thank you, for being the one I would
Bleed and kill for?
Did I thank you for tearing my head off?
Ripping my heart out
Fucking my world

Do we tell you how much we loved you?
Do we tell you you made our dreams come true?
Do we tell you you were the one?
Paving our way, the damage is done
Did we thank you for tearing our head off?
Ripping our hearts out
Fucking our world!

I can't break it

In the end
I'm pounding on the door
But It's already over
Too little, too late

In the end
He'll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

In the end
I'm pounding on the door
But It's already over
Too little, too late

In the end
He'll be my light in the dark
For when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me
