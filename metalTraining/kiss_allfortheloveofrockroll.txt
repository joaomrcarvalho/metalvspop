Yeah, yeah
I was just another child going wild in the city
Just gettin' by on a dream
I was thinking life was gonna be so pretty,
It was pretty mean
Yeah

I hit the road with no expectations
Just sleeping where I'd been
I didn't care about the fame or the money
Show me a place to play and I'm gonna go

'Cause it's all for the love of rock and roll
In my music, in the air, and I'm losing control
I don't care what you heard, I don't care what you're told
'Cause it's all for the love of rock and roll

I hitched a ride on a trip going nowhere
Got fifty bucks in a fight
Ain't a lot you know when it's over
You know the feeling, well it feels alright, alright

When you're finished with the band and some honey grabs your hand, yeah
You get to thinking you might
That's when you notice there's a ring on her finger
That's when she tells you that she's single tonight

Well it's all for the love of rock and roll
In my music, in the air, and I'm losing control
I don't care what you heard, I don't care what you're told
'Cause it's all for the love of rock and roll

I've got it made when I hit the stage at quarter to nine (yeah)
Watch them dancin' in the haze and the band's really pumping
You feel the rush and that's all it's about
I'm in for life and there's no getting out of the way

Yeah
All I want...
All I need...

Yeah, 'cause it's all for the love of rock and roll
In my music, in the air, and I'm losing control
I don't care what you heard, I don't care what you're told
'Cause it's all for my love of rock and roll
All for my love of rock and roll...
