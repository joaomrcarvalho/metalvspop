Lay it on the line
Give it some stick
No nickle no dime
Gonna pile it on thick

Rattle your cage
Moving in fast
Don't take no lip
He ain't gonna pass

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows
Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows

Don't cry me a river
Sink or swim
We're in this together
So get stuck in

Pedal to the metal
Rise or fall
Way to go now
Winner takes all

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows
Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows

Take your shot
You think you're big enough
You're gonna bite the dust
Give it all you got
You think you're tough enough

Come on bring it on

Bring it on
Step out of the shadows
Bring it on
Step out of the shadows

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows
Out of the shadows

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows
Out of the shadows
