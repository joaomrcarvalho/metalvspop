Listen honey,
Let me see you smile,
Don't be look at me funny,
You got a better style,
See me coming,
Don't look the other way,
Don't start running,
You stole my heart away,

Don't give me that run around,
You know I treat you fine,
You don't understand the way I feel,
You got my heart rolling like a wheel,

I'm In The Black, I'm In The Black, I'm In The Black again,
Can't go back, can't go back, can't be who I was back then,
It's only me, it's only me, it's only me outside your door,
Let me be, let me be, I'm the one your waiting for,

Here me talking,
You hear what I say,
I see you walking,
Every time it makes my day,
I got a notion,
I might stay a while,
If you fall in the ocean,
I'll swim a hundred miles,

Coming over to ask you out,
Ah honey please say yes,
I don't like it when you stomp and pout,
I dont' like it when you run your mouth,

I'm In The Black, I'm In The Black, I'm In The Black again,
Can't go back, can't go back, can't be who I was back then,
It's only me, it's only me, it's only me outside your door,
Let me be, let me be, I'm the one your waiting for,

Your a vision,
Make me shout out loud,
I made my decision,
Goodbye to the old school,
Send you a message,
I've gotta chance my arm,
Scramble through the wreckage,
To keep you safe from harm,

I'm going to be right around your house,
I hope you're good to go,
If you're not it's going to hit me hard,
I'm going to fold up like a house of cards,

I'm In The Black, I'm In The Black, I'm In The Black again,
Can't go back, can't go back, can't be who I was back then,
It's only me, it's only me, it's only me outside your door,
Let me be, let me be, I'm the one your waiting for
