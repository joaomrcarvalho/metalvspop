[D. Mustaine]

Your bodies empty now
As I hold you
Now your gone I miss you
But I told you
I remember bad times
More than good
There's no coming back
Even if we could
I loved you to death
If I can't have you
Than no one will
And since I won't
I'll have to kill
My only love, something
I've never felt
Now you've gone to heaven
And I'll burn in hell
I loved you to death

[solo: Mustaine]

And now I'm down below

And what do I see
You didn't go to heaven
Your down in hell with me
And now your coming back
Baby take me please!
I really think I would
If you weren't such a sleaze
I loved you once before
You kept me on a string
I'd rather go without
Than take what you would bring !
I loved you to death
