I'm a pop star threat and I'm not dead yet 
Got a super dred bet with an angel drug head 
Like a dead beat winner. I want to be a sinner 
An idolized bang for the industry killer. 
A hideous man that you don't understand 
Throw a suicide party and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap. 
It's evilsonic, It's pornoholic. 
Breakdowns, Obscenities, It's all I wanna be. 
If You're 555 then I'm 666. 
If you're 555 I'm 666. 
If you're 555 then I'm 666 (what's it like to be a heretic) 
If you're 555 I'm 666. (what's it like to be a heretic) 
Everybody's so infatuated 
Everybody's so completely sure of what we are 
Everybody defamates from miles away 
But face to face, they haven't got a thing to say 
I bleed for this and I bleed for you 
Still you look in my face like I'm sombody new 
TOY - Nobody wants anything I've got 
Which if fine becuase you're made of 
Everything - I'm - NOT! 
If You're 555 then I'm 666. 
If you're 555 I'm 666. 
If you're 555 then I'm 666 (what's it like to be a heretic) 
If you're 555 I'm 666. (what's it like to be a heretic) 
30 Seconds, 16, 8, 4, lemme tell you why 
I haven't the slightest, I'm teaching your brightest 
They're listening, clamoring 
All the money in the world can't buy me. 
GO AHEAD. LIE TO ME. 
Tell me again how you're tortured 
I wanna know how you followed your orders so well 
You're full of SHIT 
You had a dream but this ain't it. 
If You're 555 then I'm 666. 
If you're 555 I'm 666. 
If you're 555 then I'm 666 (what's it like to be a heretic) 
If you're 555 I'm 666. (what's it like to be a heretic)
