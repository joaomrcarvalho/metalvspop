Like the screaming eagle
I'm on the run
I blaze through the sky
I kill for the fun

No reason, no warning
Not shadow be found
Got you in my sights
And I'll shoot you down

Jet fighter, jet fighter
Turbo jet engines ignite
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Death will filling the sky
Jet fighter, jet fighter
An airborne assault and attack
Jet fighter, jet fighter
A cold blooded stab in the back

Vengeance is calling on you
And there's nothing that you can do
Brings you the thing you deserve
Death from above!

The chains of oppression
We'll break with our teeth
Before degradation
We'd die at your feet

So ruthless and vicious
To have no remorse
He who lives by the sword
Die by the sword

Jet fighter, jet fighter
Turbo jet engines ignite
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Death will filling the sky
Jet fighter, jet fighter
An airborne assault and attack
Jet fighter, jet fighter
A cold blooded stab in the back

Vengeance is calling on you
And there's nothing that you can do
Brings you the thing you deserve
Death from above!

Jet fighter, jet fighter
Turbo jet engines ignite
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Death will filling the sky
Jet fighter, jet fighter
An airborne assault and attack
Jet fighter, jet fighter
A cold blooded stab in the back

Vengeance is calling on you
And there's nothing that you can do
Brings you the thing you deserve
Death from above!
