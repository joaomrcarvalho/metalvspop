You say you want it loud 
I'll never turn it down 
You wanta feel my power 
Pound you in the ground 
I wanta give you fury 
Blow your head apart 
I'll leave you comatose 
From the very start 

You say you want some Metal 
I'll give you all i've got 
My deadly grasp is lethal 
This force will never stop 

POWER METAL 
ROCK FOREVER 
POWER METAL 
ON FOREVER 

I am the metal beast 
The battle dog I deal 
My soul was spawned in hell 
My body coiled steel 
Put on this earth to 
Melt it down to the core 
I'll make you feel such pain 
You're comin' back for more 

You say you want some Metal 
I'll give you all i've got 
My deadly grasp is lethal 
This force will never stop 

POWER METAL 
ROCK FOREVER 
POWER METAL 
ON FOREVER
