Mother!
You're holding my heart, screaming
Motherfucker!
They left me broken, bleeding
Son of!
The man you loved and left for
The son of a bitch!
Who tried to show me death's door

Everything's eliminated
Everything is dedicated
My belief destroyed my hated?
Never get what's over-rated

Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill
Or flowers to steal
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here

As in!
Obituaries rain down
Its ok!
We're lying naked face down

Wasn't it decapitated?
Can you see me fascinated?
Your the only thing I've damaged
What you get to be mis-managed

Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill
Or flowers to steal
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here
Dying here..

Don't bring me daffodils
Bring a Boquet of Pills
See some geranium
Cracked to the crainum
Protect me when you can
Respect me when I am
Dying

Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill
Or flowers to steal
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here
Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill
Or flowers to steal
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here
