Born of the sun
Crashed to the earth
Tormented reviled
Engorged hate from birth

Hellions the steed
Bloods on the wing
Claws set to slice
Vengeance he'll bring

Cremating the land
In seek and destroy
Apocalypse slays
Napalm he'll deploy

The beast of a god
Regalled of his race
Prepared to onslaught
And bare face to face

Across the divide
The thresholds in flames
The painkiller rises again

The scream of the demon
There's evil about
They've come to possess us
Out demons out!

Blade of the wheel
Cuts deep in the bone
It's gideons quest
To take Satan's throne

The critical mass
And power that they wield
Exterminate all when vermin rebel

A maelstrom begins
To disintegrate
And pulverise all in its' wake

The scream of the demon
There's evil about
They've come to possess us
Out demons out
