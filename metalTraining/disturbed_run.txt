Run and hide again
I want to wait this time
Don't wonder why you can't clear this final sin
You know this story was over before it began
This is a battle
You're not gonna win
Welcome to the end

I've spent a lifetime planning out your destruction
You're never gonna witness another day
Alone in my mind, planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know how long I've waited for your destruction
I'm telling you, you just can't get away
A whole lifetime planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know

You better run

Ask me why again, nowhere to go this time
Revenge will be mine again
Say goodbye, my friend
Don't run away this time and die like a man

There is no escape from my plan
Welcome to the end

I've spent a lifetime planning out your destruction
You're never going to witness another day
Alone in my mind, planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know how long I've waited for your destruction
I'm telling you, you just can't get away
A whole lifetime planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know

There is no reprieve
You don't dare to look in my eyes
We'll turn their gaze away in time
You better run!

I've spent a lifetime planning out your destruction
You're never going to witness another day
Alone in my mind, planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know how long I've waited for your destruction
I'm telling you, you just can't get away
A whole lifetime planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know

Welcome to the end

Run and hide again
I want to wait this time
Don't wonder why you can't clear this final sin
You know the story was over before it fucking began
