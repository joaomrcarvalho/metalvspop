How come, what’s wrong with you?
Darling faces often with frowns
Let’s do what devils do
Hang each other when no one’s around
Why can’t I torture you?
Giving, then you take it away
The little things you do
Simply, I love your evil ways
Your ways, your ways, your ways

Prey for me, I think I owe you an apology
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
I’m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me

This fire has followed you
Nothing’s left, you’re dead on the ground
How can I covet you?
Give you hell and you can’t rebound
My soul infected you
Blackened thoughts
They run through your head
The little things you do
Simply, I wish you were dead
Were dead, were dead, were dead

Prey for me, I think I owe you an apology
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
I’m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
(Prey for me) I think I owe you an apology
(Prey for me) Somehow you bring the violence out in me
(Prey for me) I’m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me

Good bye, so long
Wish I could stay
But everything is all wrong
Good bye, so long
Wish I could stay
But everything is all wrong

Everything is all WRONG!
Everything WRONG!
WRONG!
Everything WRONG!

Prey for me, I think I owe you an apology
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
I’m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
(Prey for me) I think I owe you an apology
(Prey for me) Somehow you bring the violence out in me
(Prey for me) I’m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
