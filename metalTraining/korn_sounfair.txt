My son is on the prowl
What's gonna happen today
Sometimes I feel empty inside
He takes that all away
Felling sorrys not allowed
There's times I have bad days
But he is still alive and well
It's all I need now

Cause I can't help 
Your cards been dealt
It's so unfair
Your eyes
They burn me
It'd hurting

The tension starts to build
The torment is his prey
Sometimes I feel I can't go on 
But I can't run away
Feeling sorrys not allowed
There's times I have bad days
But he is still alive and well 
That's all I need now

Cause I can't help
Your cards been dealt
It's so unfair
Your eyes
They burn me 
It's hurting

I can never win
You will never give in 

Cause I can't help
Your cards been dealt
It's so unfair
Your eyes 
They burn me [x3]
It's hurting
