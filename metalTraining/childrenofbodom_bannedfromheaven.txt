It's a color that I can not show
When I could easier pose
But you probably knew that I was lost

Did you think that I would right now
Show you things I have lost?
Swim if you're diving for a human being

Yaow!
I blame myself for every second
That I was gripped by some foe
Standing for the only one, for you
To kill me by your left toe

What even can I say, get me out
I was the one who sold
My body and soul to the devil
No one that I know when I say
"I am the one" would lie
Since when we spoke I stream with fire

[Chorus:]
Wake up in a pool of blood
Locked up, when you get Banned From Heaven
Looking I just saw me dripping down blood
Don't worry, I'll get up to get down where I belong

[Alexi Solo]

Banned From Heaven
Banned From Heaven
Banned From Heaven
Banned From Heaven

[Roope Solo]

[Chorus x2]
