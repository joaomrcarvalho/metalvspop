We trip the light
Firebird flies
Burn your inside

Given a lesson
The path I've shown
Follow all I know

Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlife

It came from the ocean
Gift of the sea
Lava forms the stone

Belief in power
Believe the dream
Trust your own truth

Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlife

You listen through the light
Tolling on the sea
Barren eyes behind you
Leave the shadows waking dreams
Rising through the door
Writhing with a knife
Cut speech
Cut light
Cut chord
And break the dawning wretch of silence

Trust your own truth

Souls of the fallen
Death of the godhead
Listen and breathe

Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlife
