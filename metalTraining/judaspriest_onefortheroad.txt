[Downing/Halford]

Where would you be without music
You wouldn't be nowhere it all
You wouldn't be here to invest,oh
If you weren't in heaven no more

One for the road
Staring our load
Show us the way

Can you imagine the silence
Well,thank fully we've got the boys
The melody lies fascinated
The rhythm is something divine
Send out a trend of impatience
To see you all movin' so fine
Got to find it soon

One for the road
Staring our load
Show us the way
