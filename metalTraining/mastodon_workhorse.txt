Slaved into brittle and worked for days
only thing that paves your stay
look behind you see what you've made
like a workhorse stands for miles
work for you and never get tired
roll 'em up it's time to go
we'll be back before it's too long

shaved into rhythm
work for days
consequences we have paid
to be free in a world we've made
like a workhorse stands for miles
work for you and never get tired
roll 'em up it's time to go
we can bet on all that's lost
before it's too long

burning hell
