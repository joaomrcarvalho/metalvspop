I cannot disguise, 
all the stomach pains 
and the walking of the cranes 
when you, do come out 
and you whisper up to me 
in your life of tragedy 
But I cannot grow 
till you eat the last of me 
oh when will I be free 
and you, a parasite 
just find another host 
just another fool to roast 
cause you 
my tapeworm tells me what to do 
you 
my tapeworm tells me where to go 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
I cannot deny 
all the evil traits 
and the filling of the crates 
when you, do come out 
and you slither up to me 
in your pimpin majesty 
but I cannot grow 
till you eat the last of me 
oh when will I be free 
and you, a parasite 
just find another host 
just another stool to post 
cause you 
my tapeworm tells me what to do 
you 
my tapeworm tells me where to go 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
Pull the tape worm out of me... 
I'm just sitting in my room 
with a needle in my hand 
waiting for the tomb 
of some old dying man 
sitting in my room 
with a needle in my hand 
waiting for the tomb 
of some old dying man 
cause you 
my tapeworm tells me what to do 
you 
my tapeworm tells me where to go 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, HEY 
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY
