Don't turn away
I pray you've heard
The words I've spoken
Dare to believe
Over one last time
Then I'll let the

Darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again
On my own

Carry me away
I need your strength
To get me through this
Dare to believe
Over one last time
Then I'll let the

Darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again
On my own
