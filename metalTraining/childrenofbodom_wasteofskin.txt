Open your blood shot eyes once again.
A would-be corpse filled up with pain.
The poison that I down is ominous.
They burn and hide my human being!

They all correct your poses, center around.
Blood dominates my strength to row!

Wrong, never on time
Walking travesty, just what I’ve become!
Running under rule of a madman charger,
Reaper on my trail...
Suddenly I’m betrayed!
No feeling but can see now,
They might give mercy and charge.
Guilty, execute the human being,
Deader than I signed up for!

What a waste!
I yearn for the silence,
That fills my heart with pain.
What a shame!
Human filth in my eyes,
Wish I was in my grave!

Where can I hide,
With a bloody trail by my side?
I can’t deny that I'm a living sin…
Guess I was always just a waste of skin!!

What a waste!
I run from the silence,
That fills my heart with pain.
What a shame!
Human filth in my eyes,
Wish I was in my grave.
Fuck!
