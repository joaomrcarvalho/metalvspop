[1.]
Loosing the war I'm feining to win
though I never tried to to strive deep
from within. Life could be beautiful
for anybody it's for, but I'd swear this
mothafuckin' shit is rotten to the core.
[Prech.]
The portal has been past and it's
time to make a turn, to follow the reaper
until the point of no return.

[Ch.]
When your blindly death-raying blade
sweeps the griefs and fears away.
I cross my heart and hope to die thy freedom
will be mine.

[2.]
Sinking down in the ocean of severe emotions.
Grab a bottle to drink up the pain-relieving potion.
But after all, that got boring too, so no matter
what happens, I couldn't give a damn or too.

[Prech.2.]
The portal has been past 'til the
point of no return. No more lines to cross,
no more bridges to burn.

[Ch.2.]
Now when your blindly death-raying blade
swept my griefs and tears away. I'd never go back
to cross that line.
I cross my heart and hope to die.
