People runnin'
in the street
looking for some
meat to eat
it's in your
dirty magazines
all across your 
TV screens 

Midnight Riders
in the street
feel the fire 
catch the heat 

You better go
DOWN BELOW
You better go
DOWN BELOW 

See the ladies
of the night
built for speed
to my delight
I steal them
in my limousine
hear them shout 
hear them scream 

Midnight Riders
in the street
feel the fire 
catch the heat 

It's a dirty job
but somebody's gotta do it 

S-C-R-E-A-M!!! 

You better go
DOWN BELOW
You better go
DOWN BELOW 

(And she's down for the count!)
