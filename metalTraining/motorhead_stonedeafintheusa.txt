Crossed the ocean in a silver bird,
Flying into another world,
Flying down the Pacific coast,
Flying up in a silver ghost
Love to be back in Los Angeles
L.A.X. what a sight to see,
Stone fox women, crazy days,
Table hopping at the Rainbow, babe,

Stone Deaf in the U.S.A.
Stone Deaf in the U.S.A.

Coming back to New York City
Just as crazy, ain't so pretty,
People running like crazy fools
Know you got to break the rules
You can have yourself a real good time
You can have yourself a life of crim
Hit the Limelight, make my day
Get me back to J.F.K.

[Chorus]

Been to Texas, can't get enough
Gold Virginia, fell in love
Detroit where the bad boys are
See Chicago, make you a star
Boston, Cleveland and Buffalo
Another shake, another show
Shake your ass, San Francisco Bay,
I hate to leave, I want to stay

[Chorus]
