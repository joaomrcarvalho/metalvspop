I have climbed highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls, only to be with you

But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for
No, I still haven’t found what I’m looking for

I have kissed honey lips, felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like a fire, this burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil, it was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for
No, I still haven’t found what I’m looking for

I believe in the kingdom come
And all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one, but yes, I’m still running
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame, my shame
You know I believe that

But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for
No, I still haven’t found what I’m looking for
