Still watching the sky
We ain't sure of you yet
New in town, been around
Heartbreaker for sure
Maybe running from the law
Just passing the time
Just moving down the line
Not time to fall, no time to fail
No time for anything at all
Stay out of jail...

Still facing the door
Just watching the street
City born, ripped and torn
Still turning tricks
Enough to make you sick
Just passing the buck
You might be real bad luck
Not time to fall, no time to fail
No time for anything at all
Stay out of jail...

Can't see you right now
We ain't got the time
Bad news, stand accused
A fool in drag, got your nose in a bag
Whacked out of your head
Y'all remember what I said
No time to fix
No time to bail
No time for one last call
Stay out of jail...
