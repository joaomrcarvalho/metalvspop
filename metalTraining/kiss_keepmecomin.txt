Ooh, yeah

I know what you're like, you're not sleepin' at night
I know you're losing control
I know your plans, where you're keeping your hands
I know it's taking its toll

Sweet little innocent girl
Making your way in this world
Something you're feeling tonight
Tells you what's wrong and what's right

You gotta keep me comin', keep me comin'
  (Keep me comin', keep me comin')
You gotta keep me comin', whoa, keep me comin', babe
  (Keep me comin', keep me comin')

Ooh, yeah

Hands on my shoulders now, you're getting bolder
Your fears are slipping away
Each little bite lets me know that you're ripe
You're thinkin', maybe you'll stay

Now that you're burning to know
How far you're willing to go
Now that it's under your skin
Now that you're lettin' me in

You gotta keep me comin', keep me comin'
  (Keep me comin', keep me comin')
You gotta keep me comin', whoa, keep me comin', babe
  (Keep me comin', keep me comin')

You gotta keep me comin', you gotta keep me comin'
  (Keep me comin', keep me comin')
You gotta keep me comin', whoa, keep me comin', babe
