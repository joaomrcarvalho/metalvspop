Two skies watching it all fading
Two skies living it all fading
Two skies watching it all fading
Two skies fading ones abating
Two suns living it all dying
Two suns fighting ones abiding

Two suns watching them both fighting
Two suns seeing them both dying
Two suns watching them both fighting
Two suns fighting ones abiding
Two skies seeing them both dying
Two skies fading ones abiding

Oh oh ah

Crack pipes, needles, PCP and fast cars
Kind of mix really well and a dead movie star
When I feel like talking I'll never be wrong
If I fell like walking you best come along
I close my windows crank the heat up high
till my palms are wet and my tongue is dry

I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die
I'm a midnight fist fight

Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die
I'm a midnight fist fight

Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die
All right

(Two suns fighting ones abiding)
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die...
All right

Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die...
(Two suns fighting ones abiding)
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die...
(Two skies two sons watching their own war)
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die...

All right
Yeah, alright
