I have a home
Longing to roam
I have to find you
I have to meet you

Signs of your face
Slowing your pace
I need your guidance
I need to seek my innervision
Innervision

My pupils dance
Lost in a trance
Your sacred silence
Losing all violence

Stars in their place
Mirror your face
I need to find you
I need to seek my innervision
Innervision.

It's never too late to reinvent the bicycle
A smile brings forth energy or life
Giving your force

There is only one true path to life
the road that leads to all, leads to one
(Innervision, innervision)
There is only one true path to life
the road that leads to one.
Innervision.

Your sacred silence,
Losing all violence.
