I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feeling dead on my feet
Going all the way, I'm natures beast
Do what I want and do as I please

Run - Fight - To breathe - It's tough
Now you see me now you don't
Break the walls I'm coming out

Not a prisoner I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going ...out!

If you kill me it's self defense
And if I kill ya' then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye I will defy
You'll be afraid when I call out your name

Run - Fight - To breathe - It's gonna be tough
Now you see me now you don't
Break the walls I'm coming out

Not a prisoner I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going

I'm not a number I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
Cause' I'll run rings around you
