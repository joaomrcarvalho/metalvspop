Go!

I want to tear a big hole in what is to be,
To end all this infatuation with unity,
I'm seeking my salvation alone again,
I never needed to be one of you anyway
Don't wanna be another player losing in this game
I'm trying to impress upon you
We're not the same
My own individuality is so unique,
I'm one impressive motherfucker
Now, wouldn't you say

[Chorus:]
(Break apart and)
Divide, divide, divide, divide
You might say that I'm the last man standing now,
And though you try, you'll never find a way to break me
You might say that I'm sick of being lost in the crowd,
I hear the sirens but they're never gonna take me

I am a little more provocative then you might need,
It's your shock and then your horror on which I feed
So can you tell me what exactly does freedom mean,
If I'm not free to be as twisted as I wanna be
Don't wanna be another player losing in this game
I'm trying to impress upon you
We're not the same
My psychotic mentality is so unique
I'm one aggressive motherfucker
Now, wouldn't you say

[Chorus]

(They won't take me)

Break, break, break, break
(Break apart and divide)
Break, break, break, break
(Break apart and divide)
Break, break, break, break
(Break apart and divide)
Break, break, break, break
(Break apart and divide, divide, divide)
Break apart and...

[x2]
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and divide
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and

Divide, divide, divide, divide (you might say that I'm the last man standing now)
Divide, divide, break apart and divide

Divide, divide, divide, divide (and though you try, you'll never find a way to break me)
Divide, divide Divide Divide
