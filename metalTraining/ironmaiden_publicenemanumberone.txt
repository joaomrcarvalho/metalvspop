When it all comes down the line,
And the lights they turn to greed
And you race off with your tires screaming
Rolling Thunder,
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got your fast bullet,
One way ticket outta here

[Chorus]
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its way
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In the cities in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and Riots
Politicians gamble and lie to save their skins
And the Press get fed the scapegoats
Public Enema number one

[Chorus]

A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell ya
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the Earth dies screaming

[Chorus]
