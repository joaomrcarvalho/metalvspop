A burst of speed is all I need
To set me free
A flagging start that stirs the heart
To ecstasy

Raging away I'll go far
Time waits for no man
So reach for the stars
I'm all fired up

A bolt of light that sears the night
Of things supreme
To chase the sun, forever on
And live the dream

Forcing a system aside
Too fast for this life
My mind's open wide
I'm fired up

All fired up
Fired Up
All fired up

I'm soaring, freefalling
With all emotions roaring
Like lighting, like thunder
I'll rip the world asunder

Let's go
Hold on

[Lead Break]

I'm soaring, freefalling
With all emotions roaring
Like lighting, like thunder
I'll rip the world asunder

Raging away I'll go far
Time waits for no man
So reach for the stars
I'm fired up

All fired up
Fired up
All fired up
Fired up
