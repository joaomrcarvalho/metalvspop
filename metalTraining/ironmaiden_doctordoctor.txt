Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I'm goin' fast
Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I just can't live
She walked up to me and really stole my heart
And then she started to take my body apart

[Chorus:]
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you

Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I just can't live
Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I'm goin' fast
It's only just a moment
She's turning paranoid
That's not a situation for a nervous boy

Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I'm goin' fast
Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I just can't live
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, and I can't take any more

[Chorus:]

Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I'm goin' fast
Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I just can't live
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, and I can't take any more
