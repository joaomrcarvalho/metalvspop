I'm cold, I'm ugly 
I'm always confused by everything 
I can stare into a thousand eyes 
But every smile hides a bold-faced lie 

It itches, it seethes, it festers and breathes 
My heros are dead, they died in my head 
Thin out the herd, squeeze out the pain 
Something inside me has opened up again 

Thoughts of me exemplified 
All the little flaws I have denied 
Forget today, forget whatever happened 
Everyday I see a little more of overall deficiencies 
I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe 

What the hell - did I - do to deserve - all of this? 

I save all the bullets from ignorant minds 
Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind 
Way past good taste, on our way to bad omens 
I decrease, while my symptoms increase 

God what the fuck is wrong 
You act like you knew it all along 
Your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing 

All I ever wanted out of you was 
Something you could never be 
Now take a real good look at 
What you've fucking done to me 

What the hell - did I - do to deserve - all of this? 

Gimme any reason why I'd need you, boy 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you, bitch 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 

I see you in me 

I keep my scars from prying eyes 
Incapable of ever knowing why 
Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer 

Why am I so fascinated by 
Bigger pictures, better things 
But I don't care what you think 
You'll never understand me 

What the hell - did I - do to deserve - all of this? 

Fuck!
