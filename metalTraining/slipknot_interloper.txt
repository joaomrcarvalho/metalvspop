Many have come and gone, 
Still left out of the guttural swansong 
Takin' nothin' but the best in the area, 
Givin' me grief, but fucker I'll stare you - 
down, 2-3 you're out of there, 
Maybe it's me but I'm frantic, in a panic 
Ain't never had a problem since you stopped comin' here 
Big man walkin' but bitch, I'm still talkin' 

Can't you see it's gotta be this way? 

Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 

Ain't gonna leave and you know I'm never gone fade, 
Here it comes again, gotta burn again 
Time now, throw down, don't dirty me, 
Right on your ugly-ass face cuz 

I aint the one who let you in, 
And I ain't the one who set you off 
But I know damn well when someone's pushing my buttons, 
Let tell you somethin', I'LL PUSH YOU BACK! 

"Soon as that camera goes off, he's gonna fuck that little dog." 

Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 

Gimme any reason why I'd need you (bitch) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (bitch) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (bitch) 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 

You're made of flesh.... 
(What I'm focused on)
