Now before they take me
And my blessed life
Now you'll know why death
Was summoned here tonight
I'll recall my perils
They'll kill me in pride
No, I can't run away
There's no place to hide
Though too much to live for
I owe enough to die
Ask not for salvation
My death shall mean their lives
Hatred and guilt the alter they've built
High priests of sun
Destiny, fate the wicked ones gate
Beckoning you in
Down the walkways
Through the blood stained town
Looking down the cross
Bleeding from the crown
Led to stay
To die besides the thieves
Kill the king
Of the world to be
And now to you, this will come
A putrefying pestilence
More noxious than the serpents breath
Malevolently destined
More corrupt than the malice of
Choronzon
More disease than the wind
Of the moonlight sun
Putrefaction you've caused
No need for confession
Now you wish you had a god
To stop your demolition
Crushing the bones of the hundred folds
Swinging the judgement hammer
Man, woman, child no-one is safe
The heads of the dead are the banner
And this was all you got
So don (?) these broken wings
Sands of time run out
Bells of hades ring
Is this a nightmare
To unhallow thy name
Smell of brimstone
Dancing in the flames
No help now
As you fulfill his task
Chief of evil
Has got you by the ass
St free
To shaken the throne
Just a dream?
Your weeping all alone

Looking down the cross
(speak no evil)
I'm looking down the cross
(speak no evil)
