(Malevolent criminal, I)
(When the vision paints my mind)
(Cross the invisible line)
(And you'll be paid in kind)
[REPEAT]

HIT IT!
HA HA
HA HA
HA HA

Criminal
The suffering
It makes me think like a
Criminal
The suffering
When we're alone
Criminal
The suffering
It makes me feel like a
Criminal
The suffering
When we're alone

Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
TO bury my vision

The hunger coming over me
As I learn to hide the agony
To make a final remedy
To close the door once and for all

[CHORUS]
In a world that I don't want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be free from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I can not go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

(it seems the whole experience is)
Terrible and crippling
The pain is much more than
Physical beyond belief
When we're alone

Typical enough for me
And I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To make this decision

Despair has fallen over me
No way to hide the agony
Embracing my calamity
To save myself once and for all

[CHORUS]

Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me motherfucker
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter

Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me motherfucker
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter now

Now you wanna know
Now you wanna name
Now you wanna place
Now you wanna time
Now you want it all

Now you wanna know
Now you wanna name
Now you wanna place
Now you wanna time
Now you want it all
Now

In a world that I don't want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be free from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

Don't tell me I can not go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

Don't say that it isn't so
I'm on a path that you'll never comprehend
Set me free from all of this
I need you to quicken my end
