Pack my bags and leave today,
You read this I'll be far away,
Ain't gonna give ya no moon in June,
Never see you it'll be too soon,
One eye Jack, gotta watch my back,
See you 'round, guess I better,
Shut you down  [3]
Steal your thunder, turn you round,
Listen up 'cos I'm telling you,
Magic moments were way too few,
Like to stay, but you got too weird, Don't look right
Since you grew that beard,
[Repeat]

Tell you babe, what I'm gonna do,
Leave this town and I'll leave you too,
Don't manna see your face no more,
Don't come 'round knocking at my door.
[Repeat]
