Ooh, you look good tonight
Standing there in your own world
Baby, talk to me with your eyes
Before the moment dies
I want to say to you
Time is just passing us by
You keep waiting for something called love
Wake up in the middle of the night
Nobody's gonna make it alright

Who wants to be lonely, who wants to be with you tonight, oh, oh
Who wants to be lonely, who wants to be holding you tight, oh, oh
Ooh yeah

Open yourself to me
Let me show you what it can be like
Baby, giving it all that you've got
Nothing can hold you back
Some things can stand alone
A mountain can feel no desire
But a heart isn't made out of stone
Wake up in the middle of the night
Nobody's gonna make it alright

Who wants to be lonely, who wants to be with you tonight, oh, oh
Who wants to be lonely, who wants to be holding you tight, oh, oh
Who wants to be lonely, ooh
Who wants to be lonely, all by yourself
Who wants to be lonely, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wake up in the middle of the night
Nobody's gonna make it alright

I want to say to you
Time is just passing us by
You keep waiting for something called love

Who wants to be lonely, who wants to be with you tonight, oh, oh
Who wants to be lonely, who wants to be holding you tight, oh, oh
(Ooh yeah) Who wants to be lonely
(Yeah) Who wants to be with you tonight, oh, oh (tell me tonight)
