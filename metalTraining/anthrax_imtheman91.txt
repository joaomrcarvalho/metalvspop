[Intro]
1991, Always on the run
Seven years ago we wrote this one
Like Ernest and Julio, before it's time
Seven tears later and it's holding up fine
Stupid mother fuckers like to slag us and dis
But there was no bandwagon when we wrote this
'Cause we stretched our boundarses
We opened the door
That no one attempted before
Five guys in shorts, who gives a shit
We do what we like we don't care where we fit
All you new jackey, what is N?
You're fadding me get off our days

[Verse 1]
Now we're Anthrax and we take no shit
And we don't care for writing hits
The sound you hear is what we like
And I'll steal your poptarts like I stole aissed
Go Draih the lizard or take a piss...
Watch the beat

[Chorus]
I'm on your ease, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step of sucker understand
Don't you know
I'm the man

[Verse 2]
We got real Def Rhythms and fresh new jams
If you think we've got egos will we're just hams
Scott plays stickball and likes to skate
Frankie's never on time he's always...
Drinking the drinks, the drinks I drank
I put my money in the bank
They cut their crack they offer joints
We don't do drugs do you get our meaning...
Point, point, point, point and watch the beat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
For a heavy metal band raps a different way
But we like to be different cucl not cliche
Well they say rap and metal can never mix
Well all of them can fuck our...(dickos)
Fart the Farts the Fart he Farted
I pick my nose but I'm not retarded
Like a Juce says " Smell my anal vapor "
And wipe my butt, with your fuckin' face
You stupid idiot...

[Verse 4]
Soooo, As this rap is winding down
It's plain to see I forget my hat
You know Anthrax is number one
But care we just wanna hear...(party)
Buff the buff the buff he buffed
We are the kings and dee shall buff
We're like a Diamond, that's forever
And will remain the hardest ever I.
