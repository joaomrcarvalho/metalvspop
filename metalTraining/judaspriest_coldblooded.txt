I have no face
I have no mind
I have no senses left
You see I'm blind

I feel no faith
I hear no truth
The reasonings I have
Have all come loose

There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice

I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold blood
That runs through me

I lie hear numb
My conscience clear
And all the decency
Tranfused to fear

I feel no faith
I hear no truth
The reasonings I have
Have all come loose

There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice

I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold blood
That runs through me

You took my life and all I live for
I'm left for dead
Cold blooded and in hell

There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice

I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold blood that runs through me
