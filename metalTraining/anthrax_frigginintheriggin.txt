There was a bunch of roadies 
And this here is their story 
A scurvy bunch of evil twits 
Who never say they're sorry 

They've traveled cross the nations 
Fuckin' paid vacations 
We love the schism that they make 
They're here for the duration 

Friggin' in the riggin' 
Friggin' in the riggin' 
Friggin' in the riggin' 
There was fuck all else to do 

The captains name is Rick 
Whose "Bozo-do" is slick 
He really thinks he knows it all 
He's just a Jersey hick 

Wanking, cranking, Georgie 
He always finds an orgy 
He rubs his balls and picks his nose 
He's horny Georgie porgie 

Friggin' in the riggin' 
Friggin' in the riggin' 
Friggin' in the riggin' 
There was fuck all else to do 

The kind of sleaze is Ring 
Polaroid's his thing 
He whipped it out, her teeth fell out 
And now it's in a sling 

From LA we have Troy 
His fetish is Playboy 
A smelly trout, he'll eat it out 
Go wash your hands you're M.O.I. 

Friggin' in the riggin' 
Friggin' in the riggin' 
Friggin' in the riggin'

John Tempesta is The Joker 
The Adams apple choker 
Sandra Bernhard is his twin 
He'd probably even poke her 

The B-boy was John Rooney 
He was a fuckin' loony 
He does a rap, he thinks he's black 
He's soft like Gerry Cooney 

Friggin' in the riggin' 
Friggin' in the riggin' 
Friggin' in the riggin' 
There was fuck all else to do 

Yo my name is Bill 
Dur, bouncing is my skill, duh, 
Smoke ten packs and use my plaque 
Duh, with my breath I'll kill 

Thursby is the lard ass 
The monitors are his task 
The sound they made when the band played 
Was like Ed Trunk with bad gas 

Friggin' in the riggin' 
Friggin' in the riggin' 
Friggin' in the riggin' 
There was fuck all else to do 

The photobug is Ambo 
He'll fill up any hairy hole 
We'll blindfold you with dental floss 
You burnt out fuckin' bimbo 

The bottom line is Z 
Oh please don't sit on me 
Go wipe your hemorrhoid ridden butt 
You 1960's hippie! 

Friggin' in the riggin'

This here was the story 
About our fuckin' roadies 
A scurvy bunch of evil twits
