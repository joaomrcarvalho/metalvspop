Why do I explain myself when everyone's an idiot but me?
I think some people need, I think some people need,
Killing for stupidity and I'll be born again

Kicking and screaming and dragged back into a life
Kicking and screaming and dragged back into a life
Like ten pounds in a nine pound bag
Still I come back to give you something that you never had

Idiot rules, I never fight I only win
Idiot rules, idiot rules
Idiot rules, and I didn't make them
Idiot rules, I never bend, I only break them

Finish my smoke, down my drink, wipe my mouth and I just walk away
I think some people need, I think some people need,
Killing for stupidity and I'll be born again

Kicking and screaming and dragged back into a life
Kicking and screaming and dragged back into a life
Like ten pounds in a nine pound bag
Still I come back to give you something that you never had

Idiot rules, I never fight I only win
Idiot rules, idiot rules
Idiot rules, and I didn't make them
Idiot rules, I never bend, I only break them

What's the chance of finding something real and make it last
For that I'd carry all my bags and leave them in the past
Because I spend my life fixing mistakes that left me scarred
And when I stand and meet my maker, I'll be born again hard

Why do I explain myself when everyone's an idiot but me?
I think some people need, I think some people need,
Killing for stupidity and I'll be born again

Idiot rules, I never fight I only win
Idiot rules, idiot rules
Idiot rules, and I didn't make them
Idiot rules, idiot rules
Idiot rules, I never fight I only win
Idiot rules, idiot rules
Idiot rules, don't judge me by my sins
Idiot rules, I never bend, I only break them
