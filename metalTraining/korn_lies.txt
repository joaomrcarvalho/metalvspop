I would like to search inside
For all of the things that you will hide
What's the problem?
Can't you seem to
Search through these problems that haunt and taunt you
I smile, while you're afraid
Your run, while you're so in pain

Do you ever see it [out from] outside your fears
Thinking about your life
Thinking about your inner fears

I would like to search inside
For all of the things that you will hide
What's the problem?
Can't you seem to open your body and let me touch you

I want you to see the life you have disguised
The world of things that hurt you
Kept all these useless lies
I want you to fear, fill you on up inside
Once I took you in, I'll throw you out next time
I tried, you win
My life is ripping your heart out and destroying my pain!
Go!
