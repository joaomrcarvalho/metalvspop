(We don't want them, we want everything)
(We've chosen to want everything)

We don't want them, who want everything
We've stolen in this suffering
And we told them to want everything
But use caution in what you believe
And the haunted, deny everything
Controlling in this suffering
When they're broken, and lost everything
They're so much easier to lead

Take their hope away
Take their life away
Leave them nothing left inside

[Chorus:]
When your own have died
When there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
Is that enough?
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

(Without warning, we take everything)
Without warning, we take everything
Undaunted in this suffering
The dark forces surround everything
Make it impossible to see

Take their hope away
Take their life away
Leave them nothing left inside

[Chorus]

Haven't they suffered enough
Haven't we suffered enough
Haven't they suffered enough, they're damaged more than they can bear
Haven't they suffered enough
Haven't we suffered enough
Haven't they suffered enough, they're damaged more than they can bear

Did they even have a reason why
Countless sons and daughters had to die
Can you even comprehend the pain

Tell me when your...

[Chorus]

Own have died
When there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
Is that enough?
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

[Chorus]

When your own have died (own have died)
When there's no more pride (no more pride)
When your soul is frozen
Is that enough? (is that enough?)
When your heart is broken
A thousand times (a thousand times)
With every moment
Is that enough?
