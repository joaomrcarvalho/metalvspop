Woke up to the sound of lucidity, feet on the ground
Overwhelming delight wipes out the wreck of my
Hollow mind

[Pre-chorus]
But when the dreams turn violent
Repulsive mirror likeness, if you lay out my broken bones
Beat up my heart with thirteen holes

[Chorus]
Would want to see the tragedy
Of a mind that once belonged to me
Take one good glance and you’ll agree
Like a said it’s ugly, so goddamn ugly

[Pre-Chorus]

After the terror you’ve seen
Try to act like a good human being
Guess the ship I did steer, sank in the sea
Of self loathing and fear

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Pre-chorus]
