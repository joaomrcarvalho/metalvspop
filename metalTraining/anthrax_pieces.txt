The sun is shining off his face again
Another day to reflect, I hope you understand

Looking for the sign that's let's me know
That you're fine
That you finally just found your way back home

Feel you within, feel you everywhere
You'll path the sky, will get me everywhere

So take me some place, where I will always know
That you're fine
That you finally just, found your way back home

Who's to tell me, I have to let it go
I need to say this, have to let you know
I will be here waiting for our souls to meet
I will be here waiting for your call to me

Anthony, I know you're home
Right beside me, all alone
Anthony, I have so much to say
In my heart, you will always remain
I'll never be alone...

Maybe I'm blind, maybe I don't wanna see
I distinct this fight won't play for me
Let us just think that I will, I think I know
That you're fine
That you finally just, found your way back home

I question my faith, I question everything
I need to know if this is all there is
So take me someplace where I will always know
That you're fine
That you finally just, found your way back home

Who's to tell me, I have to let it go
I need to say this, have to let you know
I will be here waiting for our souls to meet
I will be here waiting for your call to me

Anthony, I know you're home
Right beside me, all alone
Anthony, I have so much to say
In my heart, you will always remain

Anthony, my brother, my friend
I'll be with you once again
Anthony, my heart owns your faith
It will always light your day

And never be alone..
And never be alone...
And never be alone....
And never be alone.....
