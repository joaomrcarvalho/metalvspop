Nobody gives a damn about anybody else,
Think everyone should feel
The way they feel themselves,
Rich men think that happiness
Is a million dollar bills,
So how come most of them O.D.
On sleeping pills,
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
You all know what I mean,
What's the use of a cry for help,
If no one hears the scream,
No one hears the scream,
No voices in the sky,
Confusion blinds the eye,
Can't take it with you when you die,
No voices in the sky
The ones dedicate the flags
To make you brave,
They also consecrate
The headstone on your grave,
Ritual remembrance
When no one knows your name,
Don't help a single widow
Learn to fight the pain,
Politicians kissing babies
For a good luck,
T.V.Preachers sell salvation
For a buck,
You don't need no going cross,
To tell you wrong from right,
The world's worst murderers
Were those who saw the light.
