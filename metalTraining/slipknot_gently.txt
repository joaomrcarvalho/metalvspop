Gently my mind escapes into the relaxing mode of pleasure 
A pleasure that will take my mind off the reality of life 
My past life 
Life as I know it know 
And whatever may come it slowly disappears 
to somewhere in the back of my mind 
It will remain there until I wish to retrieve it 

Yes I will stay here for awhile for I need the break 
A break from the pressures of life 
and everything that lay in the palm of life's hands 

This mode is incredible 
It's out of this world 
Too bad I must always leave it 
But that's life 

That's life
