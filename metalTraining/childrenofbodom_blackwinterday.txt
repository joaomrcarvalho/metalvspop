This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed men think
Like a daybreak in spring
The sun on spring morning

Like the flat brink of a cloud
Like the dark night in autumn
But how do I feel
In my gloomy depths?

This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed men think
Like a daybreak in spring

Like the flat brink of a cloud
Like a dark night in autumn
A black winter day

This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed men think
Like a daybreak in spring

The sun on spring morning
Like the flat brink of a cloud
Like a dark night in autumn

A black winter day
Not darker than that
Gloomier than an autumn night
A black winter day
