I'm running of my time, I'm running out of breath
And now it's getting, so I can't sleep at night
in the day, I feel like death

I'm getting in far too deep, I feel they closing in
I've got to say that I'm scared, I know they'll win
Even so, I prepared

[Chorus:]
Do you believe, what you hear
Can you believe, what you see
Do you believe, what you feel
Can you believe

What is real?
Futureal
What is real?
Futureal

Wherever anyone seems to treat me like a freak
It makes me see I'm only one who feels
That I know what is real

Sometimes it feels like a game of deadly hide and seek
And when you reading this, then I will be gone
Maybe then, you will see

[Chorus 2 times]
