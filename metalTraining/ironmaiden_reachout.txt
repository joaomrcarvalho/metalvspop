It's over your head
And you don't seem to understand
One word I say
And you can't live your life
Trying to run away

You're fighting your friends
You're wearing everyone
But it never ends
You're wearing me out

Come on
Reach out [Reach out]
And let somebody into your life

Don't get me wrong
You always apologize
It's just your way
Of making a scene
You need to be loved
It's not such a crime

Come on
Reach out [Reach out]
And let somebody into your life
Come on
Reach out [Reach out]
And let somebody into your life

[Solo]

Over your head
You just don't seem to understand
One word I say
And you can't live your life
You got so much love
It's burning inside

Come on
Reach out [Reach out]
And let somebody into your life
Come on
Reach out [Reach out]
And let somebody into your life
Reach out [Reach out]
And let somebody into your life
