Change your hair
Change your clothes
I'll rearrange your face for you

If you can breathe
When I am through
I'll give it all right back to you

I wanna drink your fucking blood
I wanna break your fucking jaw
I wanna squeeze you till you're inside out
I want it all

Change your name
Change your eyes
Become the one who I despise

If you are sad
And need to cry
Then turn around and go outside

I wanna drink your fucking blood
I wanna break your fucking jaw
I wanna squeeze you till you're inside out
I want it all
