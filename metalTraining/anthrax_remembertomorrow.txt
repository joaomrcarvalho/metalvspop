Unchain the colours before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows
Tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon
The clouds take me higher
I shall return from out the hole

Tears for remembrance
And tears for joy
Tears for somebody
For this lonely boy

Out in the madness the all sleeping eye
Flickers above us to light up the sky

Unchain the colours before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows
Tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon
The clouds take me higher
I shall return from out the hole
