I've met some ladies and then some girls
But they don't tell you, they just want a whirl
It's kind of funny, a little sad
'Cause they're not happy, they're just kind of glad
To be with me for just a night
And maybe even turn out the lights, we'll turn out the lights

I need time to ease my mind, make up my mind, which one to find

[Chorus:]
Two sides of the coin to choose from, two sides of the coin, they are mine
Two sides of the coin, I'm gettin' weary
Which one should I choose, I need time

I'd like to say a word or two, about the women we all seem to know
They're all around us, they're everywhere
You meet them this place and then meet them there
Then you deside to pick a mate
Because you're tired of all those dates, of all those dates

I need time to ease my mind, make up my mind, which one to find

[chorus] - choose one!

[chorus repeats out]
