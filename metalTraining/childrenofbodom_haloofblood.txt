A cold silence washes over the night.

Dark as the blood within
The empty shell that once was you

Dreary whispers everywhere
Chant vengeance on and on
Pick up the blade. come out and play..

So you shot up among the living
Now you bleed among the dead way down below
Down you belong

I follow as you lead the way
Through a cloud of red you say
Take my hand. hit the vein. take this pain.. be my

Halo of blood. turn my tears to mud
Take this grief make me hate

Child of the night. walk with me and light the path
Lead us to the halo of blood
