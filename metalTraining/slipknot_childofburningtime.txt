Child of burning time
The child of burning time

My only consolation is all lies
The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight
Winter has returned and it always looks like rain
I cant remember anything...anything
Inside the absolution is to come
And appetites are bittersweet I think I'm coming home
A chance to give up Avarice has marked my one regret
The child of burning time has gone, he hasn't come back, he hasn't come back yet

Before I tell my story please consider who I am
I missed my window years ago, I'm doing all I can
A tragedy is commonplace but in the end they go away
A skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shame
And I cut my need into my heart, I tear it all apart
I beg you burn me away, I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today

I burn away
I burn away
I burn away
I burn away

My isolation is my course
The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source
I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame
Until this war is over I won't ever lose my rage

And I cut my need into my soul, I guess I'll never know
I beg you burn me away, I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today

Burn me away, I wont become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I wont give up tomorrow just to lose it all, lose it all today
