[Downing/Hill/Atkins]

Got no silver for my pocket
got no pillow for my head
and the winter it gets stronger
got to ease my aching head

In the morning when I wake up
Got this feeling deep inside
And I wonder if I'm dying
Or I'll got out of my mind

I still get this awful feeling
When the snow falls to the ground
It still sends my sense reeling
Knowing winter's come to town
