Hear my voice, hear my voice, hear my voice
Make your choice, make your choice, make your choice
Beat the drum, beat the drum, beat the drum
Hide the sun, hide the sun, hide the sun

Devils in my head tonight
All is wrong if it's not right, take care
Whispers in the walls I hear
Nothing ever made quite clear, beware

Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell
Make me well, make me well, make me well
Show your hand, show your hand, show your hand
Make a stand, make a stand, make a stand

Angels in my heart tonight
Say the word and make it right, so dark
Angels flying in my dreams
All is never what it seems, take heart

Speak my name, speak my name, speak my name
Feel no shame, feel no shame, feel no shame
Take your time, take your time, take your time
You are mine, you are mine, you are mine

Monsters in my eyes today
I can't make them go away, it's true
Strangers in the world it seems
Nightmare visions, fever, dreams
I dream of you
