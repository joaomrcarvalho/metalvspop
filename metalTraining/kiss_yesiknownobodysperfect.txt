Yeah!

[Verse]
I'm gonna strike while the iron's hot tonight
You got something, wanna talk about
Well I've got something you can't live without
Here comes your knight in shining armor again
And that's me baby!

Yes I know (yes I know), I'm just like all the rest
And you know (yes I know), I never pass that test
Yes I know (yes I know), I'm just like all the rest

[Chorus]
No-no-nobody's perfect
M-m-maybe I come awfully close
No-no-no-nobody's perfect
Baby, it's time you take off your clothes?
Take 'em off baby

[Verse]
Flip a coin, is it heads or tails tonight
You can't bring this boy to his knees
I guess I'm guilty, baby, if you please
If I'm going down in flames
Baby, I'm going down in style (oh yeah!)

Yes I know (yes I know), you hope we're not all the same
And you know (yes I know), I'm just playing the game
Yes I know (yes I know), I'm just like all the rest

[Chorus]
No-no-nobody's perfect
M-m-maybe I come awfully close
No-no-no-nobody's perfect
C'mon baby, take off your clothes, mama!

[Guitar Solo]

(Oh yeah!)

(Aw!)

Yeah...

(Yes I know), you've got something wanna to get off your chest
(Yes I know), now baby don't want to be screwing your head
(Yes I know), now I know it's the truth, but...

No-no-nobody's perfect, no not me!
M-m-maybe I come awfully close
No-no-no-nobody's perfect, ha-ha-ha!
(Yes I know), no-no-nobody's perfect
(Yes I know), baby nobody's perfect
(Yes I know), oh, baby please!
