Another battle's over, it's a million soldiers
Never rise again, we lost a million friends
Don't try to understand, if you weren't there
You felt different then, marching off to war

[CHORUS]

Show no quarter, delight in slaughter
Up for your last long ride, maybe God's on the other
side

Don't need no vindication, fight for the nation
You know you're going to hell, but you wear it well
You'll never understand if you weren't there
You felt different then, marching off to war

[CHORUS]
