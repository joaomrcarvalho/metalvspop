Boomerang, Zoomerang, Doomerang, Up

the time has come to realize what you are, what you've done inside
The time has come, we'll have something to talk about
I will too

Looking back. . .dumb
and now I realize. . .old man
how much you really loved him. . .dumb
This child's mind you terrorized. . . old man
You came to him. . .dumb
He really didn't know your lies. . .old man
Now, his innocence gone. . .dumb
He's that child you terrorized. . .old man

This fucking thing that I know, it came to me from you
This fucking hate that I feel, because of you
My childhood is gone, because I loved you
My childhood is gone, because I loved you

Be my neighbor
Looking back. . .child
and now I realize. . .fucker
how much you really loved him. . .child
This child's mind you hypnotized. . .fucker
You came to him. . .child
He really didn't know your lies. . .fucker
Now, his innocence gone. . .child
I'm that child you terrorized. . .fucker

[chorus]

First you told me everybody was my neighbor
they took advantage of me and then they took their turns hating me
I wish I wouldn't have watched you, I really mean it
My childhood, a failure
What a fucking neighbor

I hate you, I will too

[chorus]

This fucking hate that I feel!!!
This fucking thing that I feel!!!
My childhood is gone!!!
My childhood is gone!!!

I will too...
