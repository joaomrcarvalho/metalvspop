Walked a long long way down there...
Just to see, feel your glare

I wanna sleep just drift away...

Mother Kali... just tuck me in, take me in...

Take me out

Heaven, hell and the underworld
give me the white, the red and black...

it's all I ask, that's what I need...

[Chorus:]
if you let me love and be... true blue

I'll be more than just a dead man's hand on you

tell me lies won't be denied

mother kali... will you be my bride?

I'd paint your roses black and show you heaven

just to see your skin for one more second

it's all I want that's what I do

love me one more time and I'll let you kill me too
