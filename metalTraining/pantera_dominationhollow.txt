[Domination:]

Agony is the price
That you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you
Then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel
And manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget
When there's nothing else
Left to destroy
It's a useless ploy

Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall

It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination a now blacked heart
Is reaching out divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of you life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
Till your end forcing you to bend

Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall

It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination a now blacked heart
Is reaching out divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of you life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
Till your end forcing you to bend

[Hollow:]

What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like bothers
Talked for hours last month
About what we wanna be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel...
No one knows what's done is done
It's as if he were dead

I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

No one knows what's done is done
It's as if he were dead

He as hollow as I alone now

He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above
Mad at God
He as hollow as I converse
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through
I want to come in after you
My best friend
He as hollow as I alone
