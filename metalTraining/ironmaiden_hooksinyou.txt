I got the keys to view at number 22
Behind my Green door there's nothing to see
Is that a feature, what kind of creature,
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence, laid
back and looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around

[Chorus]
Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I
Got the hooks screwed in

[Chorus]

She's tied up she can't come to the phone,
You must have got your wires crossed cos she ain't home
Knock on wood - you know I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground

[Chorus]

Hooks in you, I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you

Right on the money got it wrapped up tight
New ideas for the decor tonight
Gonna make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete set her up on her own

[Chorus]
