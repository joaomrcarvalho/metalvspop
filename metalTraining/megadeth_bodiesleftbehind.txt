This thing called "Life" goes by so quickly
On day you're here and then you're gone
This is the moment I've lived my whole life for
And I'll never give up; I've waited too long

I've waited, waited too long, I've waited too long

And all along the road, all the bodies left behind
May all have been good friends; just not good friends of mine

I've been kicked out and said I quit
Then I said, "I had enough" and "This is it"
All I wanted was just one more show for the road
Cause it was over last time before I could blink, I could blink

I've waited, waited too long, I've waited too long

[Chorus]

Their bodies left behind

[Solo - Dave]
[Solo - Chris]
