Conquest to the lover,
And your love to the fire,
Permanence unfolding in the absolute.

Forgiveness is
The ultimate sacrifice.
Eloquence belongs,
To the conqueror.

The pictures of time and space are rearranged,
In this little piece of typical tragedy.

Justified Candy!
Brandy for the nerves,
Eloquence belongs,
To the conqueror.

You and me will all go down in history,
With a sad Statue of Liberty,
And a Generation that didn't agree.

I forgot to let you know that...

What is in us that turns a deaf ear to the cries of human suffering?!!!

WOAH!!!!!!!

Suffering, suffering now!
