Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to bend the arrow out of line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder and the wind shouts back

Grinder - looking for the meat
Grinder - wants you to eat

Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies on my scene this boy won't get caught
Refuse to bait the man trap
Be left to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere

Grinder - looking for meat
Grinder - wants you to eat

I have my licence
It came with birth
For self reliance of this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched to file me in your game

Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
On the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle
I nee d room to breath
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave

Grinder - looking for meat
Grinder - wants you to eat
Grinder - looking for meat
Grinder - wants you to eat
