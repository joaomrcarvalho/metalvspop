I don't care
They're crazy
Said pass the jam, would you
Awfully kind of you
Now wouldn't it be a little bit nice to sing with this
Gazing at the open door
Just what lays behind
Thinking what I'm looking for
Say what's on my mind
Sinking ever deeper
In the words of guilt of shame
And now I can redeem myself
I just don't care
The words I'm singing they're just right
That's better for my brain
If I try to make much sense
You know I'll go insane
I just don't care
I just don't care
Caesar had some jam with tea
But Brutus wasn't kind
Wasn't strawberries that were red
He wasn't cutting bread
You pass the jam
And so he slammed the tea
The only bugger here to me
Is in the conservatory
Yeah, alright
Yes, but still over there
Sinking ever deeper
In the words of guilt and shame
I can't redeem myself
I just don't care
Staring at the silver spoon
Take it from your mouth
Take it from the jam jar
Turn and face the South
Now face the North
And the East
And the West
And the setting sun
Still burning on in the night
Where's the sun at midnight
Say it's gone
Where's the moon at dawn
It carries on
And on
It never ends
To the land of nevermore
Where time began
Where the man still stands
And the edge, at the end
Never know that I sang
You'll all know it's the right place
In time, well it is
The words I'm singing
That's just right
They're better for my brain
If I try to make much sense
You know I'll go insane
Pass the jam
Pass the jam
Pass the fuckin' jam
Please
Next up I'll scream
I will
[he screams]
I warned you
I'm going home now
[Nicko:] Oh my goodness, that must be the first jam we've had in years!

I say pass the jam, would you
[repeat like a scratched record]
