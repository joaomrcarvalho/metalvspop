Save me from this cold embrace
Hide me from the man in black
Take me from this dreadful place
Save my life, I break your back

Shake the world, I swear I know the world
And I know what it needs
I will make all hearts to break
I make all souls to bleed
Save me from the dogs of war
Roll away the door of stone
Raise me from the killing floor
Save myself I break your bones

Will you break, will you deserve the love you take
Can you survive the fall
Are you the one to save us
Or will you just enslave us
And will you face the Law?
Wake me from this dream of blood
Now before the murder starts
I would not help you if I could
Save my head I break your heart

Shake the world, I swear I hate the world
I smell its rotten breath
Blood and souls and mind control
The world desires our death
Shake the world, I swear I love the world
The world know what I crave
More confusion, abuse and disillusion
The world defiles the brave
