Iron child out of Vulcans forge, metal scream and thrash
Red steel in the driving wheel, hear the pistons clash
Dragon breathin' big black smoke, howlin' up the tracks

[Chorus]
I'm ridin' on the Thunderchief, spit in the devil's eye
No force on earth can stop me now
Like to see 'em try
Hey, hey ridin' with the Driver

Juggernaut comin' down the line, hear the banshee cry
Engineer like to lose his mind. glory in his eye
Too fast to live this way, too young to die

[Repeat chorus]

Hold tight, feel the drivers bite, hear the whistle moan
Engine rockin' to the left and right, vibratin'  in my bones
Once the locomotive steals your soul, you got a Casey Jones

[Chorus]

I'm ridin' on the Thunderchief, spit in the devil's eye
No force on earth can hurt me now, kiss your ass goodbye
My my, ridin' with the Driver
