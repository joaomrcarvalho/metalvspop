Walked a long long way down there..
Just to see, feel your glare

I wanna sleep just drift away..

Mother Kali.. just tuck me in, take me in..

Take me out

Heaven, earth and the underworld
Give me the white, the red and black..

Its all I ask, thats what I need
Please come to me, I need to feed..

If you let me love and be.. true blue

I’ll be more than just a dead man's hand on you
Tell me lies won’t be denied
Mother Kali..will you be my bride?

I’d paint your roses black and show you heaven
Just to feel your skin for one more second
It’s all I want thats what I do
Love me one more time and I’ll let you kill me too
