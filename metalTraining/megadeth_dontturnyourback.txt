When things were good I know you would always be there for me
Yes, It's true; friends like you are few and far between
I wish I may, I wish I might, the things you do ain't quite right
Just ain't right

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend
Don't turn your back...

When things were bad you always had something else better to do
It's just a lie to think that I could ever mean anything to you
You steal what's mine then help me look for it;
how many times do I pay for it? How many times?

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend

Don't turn your back...
