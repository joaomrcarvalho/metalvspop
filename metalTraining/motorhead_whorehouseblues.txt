Well we came up from the gutter,
The wrong side of the tracks,
Yeah, we came up from the gutter,
Wrong side of the tracks,
You know the music brought us out, babe,
And we ain't never been back,
Cause we went city to city,
All around the world,
Yes, we went city to city,

We light you up real good,
Yes, we come blazing like a shooting star,
We light you up real good,
We gonna hit you like a flash of lightning,
Just like a bad boy would,

Is a little mouth harp blues,
You know the only thing that's missing,
Is a little mouth harp blues,
And you know life's full of suprises,
You know we do that to,

But we are satisfied,
No, we ain't never been good looking,
But we are satisfied,
We shoulda opened up a little Whorehouse, honey,
Get a little booty on the side
