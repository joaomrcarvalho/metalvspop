Woman, what's your name?
I know you from somewhere
Vixen, playing games
Make me think that you care
I know what you're thinking
Thinking that you're too cool
And you know what I'm thinking
Just another poor fool...

Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Show me you're a mover
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Dancing all alone
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Come a little closer
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Drive us all crazy
But I'd rather drive you home

Woman, orgasmatron
Drive me out of my mind
Teaser, getting it on
Giving me a hard time
You know what I'm thinking
Thinking you look so fine
I know what I'm thinking
Wishing you were all mine

Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Show me you're a mover
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Fire in my blood
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Come a little closer
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Don't you say I'm bad baby
You make me feel so good

Woman, you got the moves
I wish you'd give it all up
Lover, whatcha gonna do
Gonna bring me bad luck
I got half the questions
And you got half the answers
I know you know, and you know what?
You sure some kind of dancer

Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Show me you're a mover
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Tell me what you like
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Come a little closer
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Show me something new
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Keep it under cover
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
If I could do it over, then I'd do it over you...
