Burain' rubber ,and wheels of fire
A nomad's life on the open road
Storm is a comin'... A deadly choir
Pressure's mounting gonna overload

Can't you hear the rumble rising
Cant you fell it in the air... fell it everywhere

[Chorus:]
Like rollin' thunder... shakin' the world tonight
Like the rollin' thunder... ready to ignite
You can hear it, you can fell it
It's everywhere... It's in the air

Out of the distance... you feel the nightmare
Hear the bitch comin'... on the breeze
When in a Hash you realize they're right there
Panic running wild in the streets

Ground is trembling... night's exploding
Wild life fills the open air it fills the open air

[Chorus:]
Like rollin' thunder... shakin' the world tonight
Like the rollin' thunder... ready to ignite
Can you hear it, can you feel it
It's everywhere... It's in the air

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Can you feel the rollin' thunder... shakin' the world tonight
Like the rollin' thunder... ready to ignite
