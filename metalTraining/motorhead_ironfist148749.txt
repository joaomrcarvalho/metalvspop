Dark night nothing to see
Invisible hand in front of me
Scared to death there's someone near
Scared to move but you can't stay here

[CHORUS:]
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepared to die
You know me, the snake-bite kiss
Devils grip, the iron fist

Flying horse don't make a sound
Flying hooves don't touch the ground
Walk in circle lose your track
Can't go on but you can't go back

[CHORUS]

Moon eclipse and you know why
Ghost rider in the sky
Beast of evil devil hound
Tooth and claw they pull you down

[CHORUS]
