I ran from temptation
I prayed for salvation (yeah)
I screamed at God
Save me from my own damnation (yeah)
My eyes were cold and blinded
I held the page I could not read
Drew up my blood inside him
I woke up in a sweat
And heard the Lord's decree

The Devil is me
The Devil is me
I fought myself to be set free
'Cause the Devil is me (yeah)

I lived in confusion
Choked on my past illusions
I sinned a thousand times
And drank the wine
While screaming out for absolution (yeah)
I stood on mountain broken
I woke up in a sweat
And heard the Lord's decree

Take a look at yourself and tell me what you see...
The Devil is me

My eyes were cold and blinded
I held the page I could not read
Drew up my blood inside him
I woke up in a sweat
And heard the Lord's decree

Yeah!

The Devil is me...
