Fuck yes! 
Always I'm locked in my head 
Know pain, you don't know what I have had 
By now, I'm so for sure 
Right now, I am yours 

My sorrow, I swallow 
Follow me, oh hell no 

It came unknown to me 
Paranoid is controlling all of me 
Somehow, a terror so pure 
Right now, shit I'm yours 

My sorrow, I swallow 
Follow me all, oh hell no 
Wasn't me, I swallow 
Forgive me, i don't know 
Oh hell no. . . 

This thing I follow 
The place, I'm too scared to fuckin' go 
A freak, that I'm sure 
A freak, that is yours 

[chorus]

Freak . . Punk ass sissy I'm a freak. . .
