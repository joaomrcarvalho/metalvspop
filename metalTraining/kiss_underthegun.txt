Lookin' for a thrill, you'll get it my way
Let's hit the highway, I'll take you down
Shoot out in the night, lookin' for action
The main attraction is back in town
Press the pedal to the metal, on your mark, set, go

[Chorus:]
Under the gun - do your living on the trigger
Under the gun - walk on the wire
Under the gun - when the stakes are gettin' bigger
Under the gun - take aim and fire

I don't need a reason to get crazy,
I'm gettin' crazy and that's enough
Show me somethin' strange, I'll make it stranger
I swear that danger runs in my blood
Press the pedal to the metal, on your mark, set, go
When the dust begins to settle, everybody's gonna know

[chorus] - (fire, fire) fire (fire)

Well there's no speed limit where I'm comin' from
Let's hit the highway doin' 69!!
When the dust begins to settle, everybody's gonna know

[chorus]

under the gun, under the gun, under the gun
C'mon boys (fire) I can't hear you - (fire) Fire!
