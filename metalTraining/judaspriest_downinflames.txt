My last days
We shall see
They are coming now
They're after me
They want blood
Yes it's true
Going quietly I just don't do

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory

In my heart
I can say
I'll be ready for what comes my way
Don't be fooled
I can tell
Where I'm going to will serve me well

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory

Leaving my mark on the world when I've gone
Spreading the word by the deeds that I've done

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
