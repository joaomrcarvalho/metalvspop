You keep saying you got something for me
Some things you call love, but I call sex
You've been kissing when you ought-a-be-a
Screwing and now someone else can kiss your ass
These boots are made for walking
That's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you
[solo: Poland]

You keep lying and there ain't no believing
And you keep same'n when you ought-a-be-a leaving
Now what's right is right but you ain't been right yet
These boots...

[solo: Poland]

You've keep dressing ways you shouldn't be dressing
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burned ha!
I just found me a brand new box spring mattress
What you know bitch you got a lot to learn
These boots... are you ready boots

[solo: Poland]

And you think I'm kidding, dont'ya?!
