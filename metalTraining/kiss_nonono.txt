Yeah, I'm down and out, but don't count me out
Listen here babe, gonna show you what it's all about
It's time for love, and you're welcome to it
It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it
So here I am, do you want me now,
just show me where, and I'll show you how
I wanna know

[Chorus:]
No, no, no - don't say you won't if you will
No, no, no, no - don't say you've had your thrill
No, no, no - don't say you can't 'cause you can
No, no, no, no - baby don't say no, no, no

What's mine is mine, and yours is mine
Baby just sign on the dotted line
You got nine lives, like an alley cat
Just stick with me and I'll show you where it's at

You never lied, so take a bow,
that was then, babe, and this is now
I wanna know

[chorus]

Just when you thought it was s-s-safe
Gonna show you where, gonna show you how
Don't stop me now, got my foot in the door

Ooh, don't say no! Don't say no! No, no, no!

[chorus]

No, no, no, no
