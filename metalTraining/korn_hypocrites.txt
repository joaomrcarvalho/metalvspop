Your messiah was never mine [x10]

Hypocrites!
Weeping rose of Jeremiah
Drops of blood drip off your petals
Representing all our tears
in a ring of burning metal

How you wanna be, what you gonna say
it doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay

Sorcerers and Satan's come
To define the what and why
People travel across this earth
Over water, land, and sky

How you wanna be, what you gonna say
it doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches they're touching on they're dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine

Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
Your messiah was never mine

Weeping rose of Jeremiah
Purity unlike no other
Offers help to those who need it
Don't forget care to the brother

How you wanna be, what you gonna say it
Doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay
Little old lady at home
Writing out a check to send
It's all the money that she owns
She believes the world might end

How you wanna be, what you gonna say it
Doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches they're touching on they're dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine

Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
Your messiah was never mine

Hypocrites!

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches they're touching on their dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine

Hypocrites!
I'm gonna do it blind!
Hypocrites!
I'm gonna do it blind!
Hypocrites! [x4]
