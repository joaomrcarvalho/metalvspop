Once more pain is thrown my way
Can't she stay away
Every single time
Fucking with my mind
Built up all this rage
Trapped inside some cage
While she sits and smiles

Layla
Layla

Once more pain is thrown my way
Can't she stay away
Every single time
Fucking with my mind
Built up all this rage
Trapped inside some cage
While she sits and smiles

Layla
Layla

Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage

Once more pain is thrown my way
Can't she stay away
Every single time
Fucking with my mind
Built up all this rage
Trapped inside some cage
While she sits and smiles

Layla
Layla

Inside I'm afraid
Afraid of who I am
Tell me is this real
I'm a government

I have fought to find a way
I am afraid
To be who I am

Fuck

Layla
Layla

That's why I cry
This lie I drown
