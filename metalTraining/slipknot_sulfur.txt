My Guilt and My Shame always sell me short - always feel the same
And My Face and My Soul always wear me thin - always under control
But the longest hours you'll have in your life
Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right
So I'll wait, but I pray that I'm wrong
Because I think I know what's going on

So Let Me Get This Straight... the only will is my own
I do whatever I want and stay alone
All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted
I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life
But I will always find a way to survive
I'm not a failure, but I know what it's like
I can take it or leave it... or die

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like Breathing in Sulfur...

My Life is undone - and I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some
And my Gods are Untrue - I'm probably wrong, but I'm better than you
And the longest hours I've had in my life
Were the ones I went through to know I was right
So I'm safe, but I'm a little outside
I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like Breathing in Sulfur...

LIKE BREATHING IN SULFUR

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like Breathing in Sulfur...

LIKE BREATHING IN SULFUR
