[Paul]
Sometimes when the days get rough
Don't want to quit 'cause it's much too tough
I'll be around when the others are counting you out

[Gene]
Yeah...
You've heard my name, I'll see it through
There's nothing you can ask that I won't do

You know it, and I know it
There's no doubt anywhere, anyhow, any way...

[Chorus]
Stand by my side, I'll be next to you (when you need me)
Stand by my side, and we'll make it through

[Gene]
Oh yeah!
I'll be there until the end
Count on me, you've always got a friend
I'll be the last, when the others are passing you by

[Paul]
Oooh...
I'll help you win, I'll see it through
There's nothing you can ask that I won't do, no!

You know it, and I know it
There's no doubt what I'm talking about when I say

Stand by my side, I'll be next to you (we're gonna be there)
Stand by my side, and we'll make it through (we're gonna make it, yeah-yeah)
Stand by my side, I'll be there for you (we're gonna be there, be there)
Stand by my side, and we'll make it through
I'm there for you, let's go!

[Guitar Solo]

Hey!

Can you hear me?

When all the others try to take you down
I'll catch your fall before you hit the ground

Oh yeah!

No one can stop me if you need me there
I'll be the one to drop them if they dare

[Break]
Stand by my side, we'll get by, you and I
Stand by my side, I'll be there for you (you and I)
Stand by my side, (we'll get by) and we'll make it through

Stand by my side, I'll be next to you
Stand by my side, and we'll make it through (yeah, just look over your shoulder)
Stand by my side, I'll be there for you
Stand by my side, and we'll make it through
Stand by my side, I'll be next to you (Can you feel it? Can you hear it?)
Stand by my side, and we'll make it through
Stand by my side, I'll be there for you (We're gonna make it baby)
Stand (Yeah) by my side, and we'll make it through (Baby)
