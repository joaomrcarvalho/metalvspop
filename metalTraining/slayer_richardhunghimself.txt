Needles stabbed into the walls
The executioners curtain call
Fighting back he found his identity
And there was no way out

Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With slashing, and stabbing, and maiming and ramming

Death threw his black curtains
Where his clothes once lied
The roof kicked out and the rope tied to the rafters
A quick kick of the chair
And it was all through
If Richie only knew

Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With needles, injecting and shooting subcutaneously

His life suddenly flashed right before his eyes
What a swinging guy
Turning gray with mold
This is when he died

Give it up [x2]
Throw it all away

Burning acid bath
Pulmonary wrath
Feel the boiling surge
It won't let you go

Throw it all away [2x]
Throw it all a....... [2x]
Throw it all away

Swinging in his room
Richie won't come out to play
That poor bastard hung himself the other day
Oh how the years seem to fly by
Is death the final high

'cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With slashing and stabbing and ripping
And stabbing and shredding and slashing
And shredding and stabbing and ripping
And tearing attacking and maiming
And taking the body that god gave to you

I gotta get out

'cause Richard hung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)
'cause Richard swung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)
'cause Richard strung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)
The needle, it stung itself ('cause Richard hung himself)
They pulled him right off the fucking shelf ('cause Richard hung himself)
That poor bastard, man he hung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)

To fucking think of himself
