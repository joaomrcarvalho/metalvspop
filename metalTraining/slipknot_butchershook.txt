Contrite - Commercial - Arrogance - Leprosy
Consume The Bitch - The Fucker - Mindless - Like A Child
For Pity's Sake - I've Had All That I Can Take
We Try - But In The End We'll See
There Are No More Codes
Only Who Is Shit / And Who's Still Free
I was gonna change the world with Honor and Aggression
No one listened - no one cared
All they saw was misdirection

GO AHEAD AND DISAGREE / I'm giving up again...

I DON'T WANT YOU ANYMORE
I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE
Fingerprint of God / Your new religions covet
This vessel wasn't built to last
But I will live forever/ you'll never have to say surrender
Because you're so part of it
My total honesty has no place for Tomorrow
Guilty pleasures give me pain
Tell my people I CAN'T FOLLOW

GO AHEAD AND DISAGREE / I'm giving up again...

You'll never CENSOR me / You'd better CHERISH me
My REASON has a voice / Freedom's gone but we'll always have a CHOICE
My PRESENT FUTURE TENSE / It doesn't make much SENSE
I'm coming after you / FUCK YOU ALL I'M THE ONLY POINT OF VIEW

Violence and Dollar Signs / Another processed piece of shit
You hide your fault in DIAMONDS and give away the only
COST - you can't delay the inevitable
LOST - don't understand the incredible path
I'm losing ground - but I won't care when I go down

GO AHEAD AND DISAGREE / I'm giving up again...

I'M GIVING UP AGAIN
