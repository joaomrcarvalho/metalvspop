Wake up on fire every day
And I never say goodbye
Pre-determined destiny
I've never been afraid to die

Ever since i was a kid
I've seen things my own way, with my own eyes
With my hands i turn the screws
In my life i decide

You're bent on under the will of endless dogmatic restraints
I will rage against the machine* spewing out blind faith#

Think about an end u can live with
Think about an end i can give u
Think about an end that would satisfy

The only thing that's touched my soul
Ever in my life of love
Tangible and Physical visable
Unlike your god above

Where is all the mercy on which your faith has been built
All i see is hatred caused by years of inbred guilt

Resurrecting genuflecting killing in the name*
You disavow the right to choose
Its medievally insane

Your god is dead or doesn't care
Tell me which ones worse
An uncaring god or knowing that your alone on this earth?
