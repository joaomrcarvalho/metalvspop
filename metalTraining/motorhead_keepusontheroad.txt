We began at the beginning,
Moving high and moving fast,
Machine's clean, so sweet and mean,
Should have known it wouldn't last,
But when I took her clothes off
I thought she would explode,
Dropped another handful,
Kept Us On The Road
The black things came from nowhere,
But they couldn't beat the shield,
They flew across the highway,
But we smashed them in the field,
But when I made a suggestion
I thought she would explode,
Dropped another handful,
Keep Us On The Road
It was round about the third day,
I remember it so clear,
We came across a bad vibe,
Naked, blind with fear,
And that was all we left there,
Ain't moving staring cold,
Dropped another handful,
Keep Us On The Road
