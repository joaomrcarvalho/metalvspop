Lift you up again, give you to the trees
All sound and visions are what they ask of me
Let's run fast through the fields, over mountain tops
Let's swim through ocean water, and we'll never stop

Just close your eyes
And pretend that everything's fine
Just close your eyes
I'll tell you when

Can you show me where to find the stream
I've been told before that the water's clean
Will you come with me, two of us can drink
Move quick, we've got to hurry
There's no time to think

Just close your eyes
And pretend that everything's fine
Just close your eyes
I'll tell you when

We didn't come this far just to turn around
We didn't come this far just to run away
Just ahead, we will hear the sound
The sound that gives us a brand new day

Just close your eyes
And pretend that everything's fine
Just close your eyes
I'll tell you when
