If there isn't light when no one sees
then how can I know what you might believe?
A story told that can't be real
somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeah

Fade away, fade away
vanish into small
Fade away, fade away
break the crystal ball - OH!

It's the sign
feels like the time!

On a small world, west of wonder
somwhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
when the summer falls
If an echo darts in dancer
when it hears a certain song
Then the beast is free to wander
but never is seen around

And it's the Sign of the Southern Cross
it's the Sign of the Southern Cross
all right
sail away
to the sign
ohh

From the book, the word is spoken
whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
they will make us strong
Reach above your dreams of pleasure
given life to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
sail the ship of signs

And it's the Sign of the Southern Cross
it's the Sign of the Southern Cross
Fade away, fade away
break the crystal ball
Fade away, fade away
I can't accept it anymore

On a real world, west of wonder
somwhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow, see it shimmer
when the summer falls
From the book, the word is spoken
whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
they will make us strong!

It's the Sign of the Southern Cross
It's the Sign of the Southern Cross

Don't live for pleasure
make life your treasure
Fade away!
Eight miles high, about to fall
and no one there to catch you
look for the sign, the time
the Sign of the Southern Cross, yeah
