And you know my face
And how it is I know you
Something so familiar
I can’t recognize

And I slip, and I slip
As I slip unstuck in time

Gotta find my constant
Or my mind is lost

Stronger, than any stretch of my imagination
Spanning, my world my all

Am I here now in between undivided?
I am whole now, so hear me

Scream as my heart pound
Moving too fast now
I am here, I am here
Lost in the moment
Caught in the current
I am here, I am here
Scream as my heart pound
Burn out the past now
I am here, I am here

Now close my eyes, take the paste and
Burn it, burn it
Burn it down

I’m here, I’m there
Slipstream I scream
Tell me you hear me
My time is here, my place is now

And I slip, and I slip
As I sleep through space I’m tethered
A lifeline to cross time back at you

If I could change one thing I’d
Take back all the lost time
I spent away from your side
Go back and make I right
