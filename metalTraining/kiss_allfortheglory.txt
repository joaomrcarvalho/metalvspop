[Verse]
Out on the street and my heart starts to beat like a drum
If you're gonna stand beside me, get ready to run
I life my life the way I choose
I play win, no time to lose

[Chorus]
We're all for one (all for one)
And we're all for the glory (all for the glory)
We're all for one and we're all for the glory
Yeah, we're all for one (all for one)
When it's all said and done you're gonna know the story
'Cause we're all for one (all for one)
And we're all for the glory, glory now

[Verse]
Everybody wants to follow wherever we go
They hang around all places and people we know
We live the life, we've paid our dues
We're hanging tight, we make our news

[Chorus]

[Guitar Solo]

Oh yeah!
I don't run, I don't hide
Take a look, you won't see fear in my eyes
One way, my way!
If there's a price to pay for all that I've got
I'll give it all gonna take my shot

All for one, we're all for the glory (yeah-yeah)
All for one, we're all for the glory (all for the glory)
All for one, we're all for the glory
All for the glory
Yes, we're all for the glory (we're all for one and we're all for the glory)
We're all for one (all for one)
We're all for the glory (we're all for one and we're all for the glory)
When it's all said and done you're gonna know the story
'Cause we're all for one (all for one)
And we're all for the glory, glory now
We're all for the glory (we're all for one and we're all for the glory)
When it's all said and done you're gonna know the story
'Cause we're all for one (all for one)
And we're all for the glory, glory now
All for the glory
