Christmas
Christmas 
Christmas

Light the lights, ring the chimes
Come on in its party time
Raise a glass for old lang syne
Come on and rock it up for all mankind
Good to see friends I know 
Kissin' under the mistletoe
I love to hear the children sing
It looks like santa's gonna' bring...

(another rock and roll Christmas)
Another Christmas rock and roll
Presents hangin' from the tree
You'll never guess what you've got from me
(another rock and roll Christmas)
Another Christmas rock and roll
You better be off home, shut up tight 
You never know it might snow tonight

Guys and gals stay up late
They're so excited they can't wait
Let there be peace on earth
Come on and rock and roll for all your worth
Were gonna' laugh were gonna' sing
Were gonna' make the rafters ring
Pull my cracker
Let me be the silver star upon your tree

(another rock and roll Christmas)
Another Christmas rock and roll
All dressed up so here we go
Do I hear sleigh bells in the snow?
(another rock and roll Christmas)
Another Christmas rock and roll
Tonight old santa never ever stops
He rocks around the chimney tops

And you'll be rockin' in your stockin'
When you see your big surprise
Cause you'll be rockin' in your stockin
You won't believe your big blue eyes

Come on in join the fun
It's Christmas time for everyone
May your days be merry and bright
This ain't gonna' be no silent night
See the stars glittering
Soon they're gonna' see the new year in
Everyone's huggin kiss me quick
I'm gonna rock and roll for old saint nick
