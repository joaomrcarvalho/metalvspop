Another town, another place
Another girl, another face
Another truck, another race

Eatin' junk, feelin' bad
Another night, goin' mad
My Woman leavin' I'm so sad

But I just love the life I lead
Another beer is what I need
Another gig, my ears bleed
We are the road crew

Another town, left behind
Another drink, completely blind
Another hotel I can't find

Another backstage pass for you
Another tube of superglue
Another border to get through

Drivin' like a maniac
Drivin' way to hell and back
Another room a case to pack
We are the road crew

Another hotel, we can burn
Another screw, another turn
Another Europe map to learn

Another truckstop on the way
Another game that I can play
Another word I learned to say

Another bloody customs post
Another fucking foreign coast
Another set of scars to boast
We are the road crew
