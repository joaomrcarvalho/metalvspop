The time had finally come to kill the vein.
And I'm dropping down the dirt on your grave
It might hurt so bad, but I can't feel sad
Rid of a fool like you
The wrath has just begun
The time has finally come
And it hurts so bad, and it drives me mad
Life with a blinded view (of you)

It makes them disappear
It fills their life with fear
When their future isn't clear
It makes them disappear

- Gone -

So the coward has up and run to be saved
But with each step taken down, you sink in your grave
It might hurt so bad, but I can't feel sad
Rid of a fool like you

Get the fuck on down the road
