You've got nowhere to hide, and all bullshit aside 
You've committed a terrible crime 
You've stepped over the line and you'd better be running for your life 
Fucked over again, I even called you a friend 
A mistake I won't be repeating 
I just don't understand how you can even continue to deny 

You know why 
(You don't remember why) 
Don't you pretend that you don't know why 
(You fucking parasite) 
Because you're living through association that has been getting you high 
You sell your soul for just a taste of my life 

Now what a surprise, to discover the lies 
You'll be telling again in no time 
You just don't realize they'll come back and be fucking up your life 
In trouble again, I just don't understand 
This whole pattern that keeps repeating 
You know you'll do it again and admit you can step into the light 

You know why 
(You don't remember why) 
Don't you pretend that you don't know why 
(You fucking parasite) 
Because you're living through association that has been getting you high 
You sell your soul for just a taste of my life 

Determination has been running on high 
No control, for just a taste of my life 

Because your association has been getting you high 
You sell your soul for just a taste of my life 

Determination has been running on high 
No control, for just a taste of my life 

For just a taste of my life 

You've got nowhere to hide and all bullshit aside 
You've committed a terrible crime 
You've stepped over the line and you'd better be running for your life
