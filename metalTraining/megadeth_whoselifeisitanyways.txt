Ooh, you're just in time to get inside my head
Ooh, the war of words you're underneath my skin

You hate the way I wear my clothes
You hate my friends and where we go
I see you in the shadows

You think you know what's best for me
You hate everything you see in me
Have you looked in a mirror?

Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live, but who asked you anyway
Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?
Cost so much more than the price I ain't going pay

You only point out fault; anxiety attack
You running your mouth, you stab me in my back

[Chorus]
