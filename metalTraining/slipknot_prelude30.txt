I don't know why...
...I never told you
I don't know why... 
...I never tried

When we shed these bitter skins again

All the reasons come to life
But now it's over..
Now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over 

I don't know why
You never asked me 
And I don't know why
You never cared

When we hide these little sins again

All the reasons
Have to die...
But now it's over
Now it's over
And now it's over
And now it's over
And now it's over! [x4]

No!
