Life Threatening Lifestyles, 
A hitman, a Nun, Lovers,
Art thou not Human Man [X 8]
Not human man Art thou
clock Men for they will fail, 
fear not the gods that come from the sky, 
long not for the one who've lost their way, 
Arise as did the gods Ninti, 
Arise as did the gods Ninti, 
Arise as did the gods Ninti,
And Ishkur, Ishkur
