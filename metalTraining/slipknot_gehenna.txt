Do you Believe? Do you Fade like a Dream?
Let me hear you BREATHE
Let me watch as you sleep
The Sparrow's Eyes... Promises shift into judgments
I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments

The Blood and The Body - Control the cut so it's seamless
Show me your Heart - Show me the way to complete this
TETHERED / to a scene I / TREASURE / can you help me?
I / SEVER/ god it's perfect, it's / NEVER / really perfect
Now... I can finally be myself
Cuz I don't want to be myself

FREE MY SEVERED HEART, GIVE ME YOU - I WANT IT
(I don't want to be myself)

I cannot maintain a semblance of Normal anymore
I'd rather feel pain than try to fit in with you anymore
I'll throw it all away, like everybody else
I can finally be myself
Cuz I don't want to be myself

FREE MY SEVERED HEART, GIVE ME YOU - I WANT IT
(I don't want to be myself)
