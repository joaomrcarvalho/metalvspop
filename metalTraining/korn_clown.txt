Anger inside builds within my body
Why you hit me? What have I done?
You tried to hit me!

Scream at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me

What's with you boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest
Be yourself, a cowardly man!

I don't run around trying to be what's not within me
Look into my eyes, I am free
You're just a wannabe

Scream at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me

What's with you boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest
Be yourself, a cowardly man!

To come out

Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown
Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown
Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown
Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown

Clown you ain't shit. Turn around get your face split
Clown you ain't shit. Turn around get your face split
Clown you ain't shit. Turn around get your face split
Clown you ain't shit. Turn around get your face split

Time if you'd like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me

What's with you boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest
Be yourself, a cowardly man!
