I see you had your mind all made up
you group of pitiful liars.
Before I woke to face the day,
your master plan transpired.
Something told me
this job had more to meet the eye.
My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?
Now I'm unwhole.

[bridge:]
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are.
Can't leave the scar.
You cry for compensation.
I ask you please just give us...

[chorus:]
5 minutes alone

I read your eyes, your mind was made up.
You took me for a fool.
You used complexion of my skin
for a counter racist tool.
You can't burn me
I've spilled my guts out in the past.
Taken advantage of
because you know where I've come.
My past.
