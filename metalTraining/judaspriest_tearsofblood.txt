Shattered in the name of God
Shattered - batter never spare the rod
Eradicate till nothing's left
As they run you through
Shattered - battered slay the chosen fey

Tears of blood
Always falling
Tears of blood
On holy ground

Savaged for this desperate cause
Savaged - ravaged left with no remorse
Eternal life's divisive lie
Evades each mortal man
Savaged - ravaged destroying what you can

Tears of blood
Always falling
Tears of blood
On holy ground
Tears of blood
Always falling
We are weakened by your tears of blood

Hate lies till the very end
Faith dies by the hands of friends

Stay alive and live
Like you did before
Give your life to live forever
Forever more

Tears of blood
Always falling
Tears of blood
On holy ground
Tears of blood
Always falling

We are weakened by your tears of blood

Crying tears of blood
Crying tears of blood
