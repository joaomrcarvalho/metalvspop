Midnight runaway, know you're running scared
Bright lights, big city, nobody seems to care
Open your eyes who's there, who's there
Open your eyes, nightmare
Unclean, fever dream on the high side, in the Mean Machine

Black bomber in the night, can you handle the pain
Better call the FBI, better change your name
Open your eyes, oh no, oh no
Open your eyes, creepshow
Unclean, fever dream, on the wild side in the Mean Machine

Unclean, fever dream, take a ride Mean Machine
Wet dream, bad scene, we don't care where you been
On the screen, movie queen, things ain't always
What they seem. stay clean, crazy dream
Off the high side in the Mean Machine
