I'm your witch doctor, got an evil eye
I'm your witch doctor, set souls on your fire
Gonna bring you love, in the midnight hour
Gonna feel you burning like a passion flower
I'm singing ....
Your witch doctor, your witch doctor
Got my eyes on you
I need a voodoo and that's at night
I'll be your voodoo in the morning light
Gonna bring you love, in the midnight hour
Gonna feel you burning like a passion flower
I'm singing ....
Your witch doctor, your witch doctor
Got my eyes on you
Your witch doctor, your witch doctor
Got my eyes on you
I got my mean old spell on you
I got my mean old spell on you
Your witch doctor, your witch doctor
Got my eyes on you
I'm your witch doctor, got an evil eye
I'm your witch doctor, set souls on your fire
Gonna bring you love, in the midnight hour
Gonna feel you burning like a passion flower
I'm singing ....
Your witch doctor, your witch doctor
Got my eyes on you
