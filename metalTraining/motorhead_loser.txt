I'm a loser
I'm a loser, that's what they said
That's what they said
Now I got their women in my bed
You buy me a drink and you wish that I was dead

I'm a loser
I'm a loser and I don't know their names
I don't know their names
Call me a superstar, play that game
Cost you a million just to sign your name

I'm a loser
I'm a loser they turn me around
Turn me around
Big wide smile gonna bring me down
They don't know your arse from a hole in the ground
