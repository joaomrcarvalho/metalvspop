A swine
An addict
A slave
To that accel forward
Till you just burn, till wreck
And now your falling
Pain potions getting well
Though they hammer you into the ground

Bastard of Bodom, reporting
That sharp pain always go's away
How did I get here once again?

I have to shoot to survive
Otherwise screech "I wanna fucking die"
But I need the bottle and I'll be fine

To the final hammering
Suffer internal
Wanna feeling? and be fine?

On the verge, were never scared
Everything is through with me
This time it's got inside

Bow down to the points of life
Take a scream down Bottom Limb Drive
From the tip of a glass, I'm feeling fine

A have barely come to the point,
To make a motherfucking sure bitch
Wanna wish
Mix beer with pure wine

Sleeves up, lightning sucker punch
Can't stand my jumper cables on my junk?
Why would you worry 'bout me?

Fucked up rolling on the floor
Going down like a whore
Just like lightning from the sky
Another roadkill morning, break down and cry

Sleeves up, lightning sucker punch
Can't stand my jumper cables on my junk?
Why would you worry 'bout me?

Bastard of Bodom, reporting
That sharp pain always go's away
How did I get here once again?

I have to shoot to survive
Otherwise screech "I wanna fucking die"
I need the bottle and I'll be fine

Fucked up rolling on the floor
Going down like a whore
Just like lightning from the sky
Anything roadkill morning, say goodbye and DIE!
