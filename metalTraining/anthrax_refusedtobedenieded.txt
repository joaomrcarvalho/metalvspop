Proud and free that's American to me
Symptomatically, and so basically
it's so definite, freedom is all of it
no humaity without restraint
refuse to be denied refuse to compromise
your ideology always a lie
it's jigoistic or nationalistic
or whatever the hell you want to call it
with my raised fist
never to be denied
I stand and resist again
proud and free that's a human thing to me
burning at the core and I'd go to war
ain't gonna change my way of life
twisted rhetoric, I won't subscrive
refuse to be denied refuse to compromise
your ideology always a like
imperialistic colonialistic
bandwagon patriot wake up to this
with my raised fist
never to be denied
I stand and resist again
