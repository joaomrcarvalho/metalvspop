Lost in slumber, a threat to no one
Weak and humbled to my disgrace
Sweet departure, is what I long for
Careless moments to comfort me
Dead philosophy..

If I offer you my soul, will you carry me away?
I cannot be the only one, to be dehumanized again--Left behind

Too determined, to be forgotten
Nothing left to enrapture me
Hard and silent, soflty breaking
No beloving to comfort me
Ooh dead philosophy...

If I offer you my soul, will you carry me away?
I can not be the only one, to be dehumanized again--Left behind

Feel the determination built into my mind
You're never gonna find me, I'll wipe the world away
Your face it will remind me, just how much I have to leave

If I offer you my soul, will you carry me away?
I cannot be the only one to be dehumanized again
Said if I offer you my soul, will you carry me away?"
I cannot be the only one, to be dehumanized again--Left behind
Into my mind...
