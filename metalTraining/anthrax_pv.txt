It was a day to remember
Twice as hard as long
That was the day that I convinced myself
That I found my god

I tip my cap and I step up
I fix myself to the right
I move right into the firing zone
And scream "drink or fight"
It's just a matter of respect
Or is that something I missed
This ain't no peace train that you're jumping on
So shake my hand and shake it strong
And everybody come along

(am I) Long
(am I) Strong
(am I) Everybody come along
(am I) Long
(am I) Strong
(am I) Everybody come along

Sometimes I can't stop the shaking
At least I know I'm not dead
I don't remember whose blood this is
I've got a hammer inside my head

I get up, I get put down
And I don't even try
I've burned a bridge, I've burned a whole town
Cause I'm fortified
I tell the truth or just a gilded lie
And then I charge like a bull with his balls tied
This ain't no peace train that you're jumping on
So shake my hand and shake it strong
And everybody come along

(am I) Long
(am I) Strong
(am I) Everybody come along
(am I) Long
(am I) Strong
(am I) Everybody come along

A heavy dose of reality
With a side of piss and vinegar
A free drink at the bar and you'll take it

So shake my hand and shake it strong
And everybody come along

(am I) Long
(am I) Strong
(am I) Everybody come along
(am I) Long
(am I) Strong
(am I) Everybody come along

A heavy dose of reality
With a side of piss and vinegar
A swift kick in the ass and you'll take it
Take it
