"Tears aren't a woman's only weapon."
"The best one's between your legs."
"Learn how to use it."
"Drink."

Protect your blood
At any cost
Burning a mark on your name
Our honor is lost

(This will end it)
(This will end it)
(This will end it)

War!
Betrayal at the core
Pretend to take the throne
In an incest war
It's war
You suffer of the truth
Lousy shore!
Humiliation!
Degradation!
Violation!

Truth that will kill you
Their power it lies
The Lords of the rock claim
You win or you die

Gave them your lives
Your debt was paid
And there’s a hand before you
So perfectly played

The evil, they will you
So deadly betrayed
The Lords of the rock claim
You win or you die

Or you die!
Or you die!
You win or you die!
Or you die!
You win or you die!

Yeah
Truth that will kill you

The Lords of the rock claim
You win or you die

So deadly betrayed
(Deadly betrayed)
The Lords of the rock claim

Or you die!

Die!
Or you die!
