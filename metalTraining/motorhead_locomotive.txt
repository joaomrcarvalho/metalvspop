You know I'm rollin' know I'm coming through
Hear me howlin', catchin' up on you
Station to station, beating up the track
Check on your time, 'cos I ain't never coming back.

[CHORUS:]
You know I'm loaded, railroaded
I'm explosive, I'm a locomotive

I'm your engineer, looping up the curve
Stoke up your fire babe, burning up your nerve
You know the story, know that I can't fail
Power and glory, burning up the rails

[CHORUS]

Roll you all night babe, drive you round the bend
Broke down engine fired up again
Ain't got no brakeman, got no mail to drop
Rollin' forever, never gonna stop

[CHORUS]
