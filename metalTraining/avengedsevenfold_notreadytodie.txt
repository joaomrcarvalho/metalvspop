Gone, cast away in time
Evil yours, now evil mine
So I robbed you blind
The voices in my head suggest a less than peaceful side

The endless possibilities
Controlling 9-3-5.

You can't break me
Crush the fears of yesterday
You can't save me
Barriers of trust will fade.

I've stood in the dark
Been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive
I'm not ready to die

Damned, watch the masses fall
Burn it down, control 'em all
(Help me) Make me crawl
To daddy's little girl I'll read the writings on the wall

While cast into the nothingness
Their final curtain call

You can't break me
Crush the fears of yesterday
You can't save me,
Barriers of trust will fade.

I've stood in the dark
Been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive,
I'm not ready to die

[Guitar solo]

Through the madness we find
Loyalty is no match for power
Say goodbye to your life,
Left to rot in your darkest hour
Prayers won't help you now
As long as you're mine

[Guitar solo]

You can't break me
Crush the fears of yesterday
You can't save me
Barriers of trust will fade.

I've stood in the dark
Been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive

I'll control the world
One person at a time
As I damn the dead I'm trying to survive
I'm not ready to die!

Oh!

I'm not ready to die!
I'm not ready to die!
I'm not ready to die!
I'm not ready to die!
Ready to die!
Ready to die!
Ready to die!
Not ready to die!
