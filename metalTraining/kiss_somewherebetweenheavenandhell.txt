I'd have to be a mindreader, baby, just to know what's goin' on
You don't need no crystal ball, sugar, can't you see my love is strong

Don't you know my temperature is startin' to rise up
And it's draggin' me under your spell

[Chorus:]
Somewhere between heaven and hell
Sometimes I think you want to, but I can never tell
Somewhere between pleasure and pain
I'm about to go insane, I'm so hungry, I'm so hungry

You don't have to see no furtune teller, to see I just can't take no more
You been such a heartbreaker, baby, you keep a lock on heaven's door

Ain't you tired of goin' through the motions
And standin' in the shadow of love

Somewhere between heaven and hell
Sometimes I think you want to, but I can never tell
Somewhere between the truth and a lie
Sometimes I wonder why, I can't hurt you, I can't hurt you

Don't need your lovin', don't want nothin'
Don't need your sympathy, don't need a friend
I just need somethin' I can believe in, I can believe in

Ain't you tired of goin' through the motions
And hidin' in the shadow of love

I'm somewhere between heaven and hell
Sometimes I think you want me, but I can never tell
Somewhere between pleasure and pain
I'm about to go insane, I'm so hungry
Somewhere between love and hate
Don't know just what I'm feelin', babe I think it's gettin' late
Somewhere between the truth and a lie
Sometimes I wonder why, I can't hurt you...
