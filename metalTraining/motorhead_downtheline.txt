Hey babe, you gotta wake up now,
I got something to say,
The way I feel I can't stay here
I gotta leave today,
I can't stand to settle down,
I gotta catch a ride
I gotta get outta here,
Because I wanna be outside,

You look just as good to me,
And you ain't done nothing wrong,
There's places that I gotta be,
I been standing still too long,
Baby please don't be mad,
you treated me real fine,
Best thing I ever had

[Chorus]
But I gotta move on, down the line,

I gotta be in the wind,
I wanna see the sun
I know I can't be still no more,
Not now the still has gone,
I can't waste no more time,
So I'll be on my way,
You know I tried real hard,
I tried so hard to stay here,

I don't know what's wrong with me
I don't know what I'm running from,
I got some other place to be,
And I'm gonna try it on
Baby please don't be cold,
You treated me real fine
You treated me like gold,

[Chorus]
But I gotta move on, down the line

Baby I gotta go, know I've got to move,
Gotta take a gamble,
Even though I'm born to lose,
I'll pass this way again,
I'll see you by and by,
I wish that I could stay,
I wish that I was lying,

You been real good to me
But it's time that I was gone,
There's things you just can't see,
And there's something going on,

Baby please don't be sad
You treated me real fine
I know I must be mad,
But I gotta move, gotta move
Move on down the line.
