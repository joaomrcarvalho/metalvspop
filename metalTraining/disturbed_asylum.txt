Release me

No remnants were ever found of it
Feeling the hot bile
With every fake smile
Though no evidence was ever found
It never went away completely

I try to hide from the unholy sound of it
Another day gone
Another night's dawn
Dark forces pull me underground
They never went away completely

How can I feel this empty?
I will not recover this time
This loneliness is killing me

Will I never know peace of mind again?
I don't believe it
I can't achieve it
I think it all is just another sign
> That never went away completely

Terror is coursing in me
Dreading the final moments
When I have to dream
And feel you die
([Background:] Death inside of me keeps a diligent watch on everything.
Keeps a terrible hold on my belief.
Just waiting for the moment when I...)

In Asylum (I live a lie)
Don't you know I'm in love with you
And I wasn't ready
For Asylum (Relive a lie)
To let go
Now it's dragging me into your grave
Your Asylum (Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling that I won't get to join you in time
For the loneliness is killing me

Death's images are all around again
They're right behind me
They're gonna find me
Judgment for the immortal sin
That had enveloped me completely

I know I'll never know a peaceful night again
Afraid they'll hear me
They don't fear me
Punishment for the immoral crime
The debt was never paid completely

Terror is coursing in me
Dreading the final moments
When I have to dream
And feel you die
([Background:] Death inside of me keeps a diligent watch on everything.
Keeps a terrible hold on my belief.
Just waiting for the moment when I...)

In Asylum (I live a lie)
Don't you know I'm in love with you
And I wasn't ready
For Asylum (Relive a lie)
To let go
Now it's dragging me into your grave
Your Asylum (Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling that I won't get to join you in time
For the loneliness is killing me

In the end there will be no suffering (more suffering)
In the end you will find out everything (not anything)
In the end you may question your belief (what belief)
In the end you will realize someday
How you were deceived

This has gone on too long (too long)
No more demonic dreams
Destroyer come to light
Because the memory is killing me

In Asylum (I live a lie)
I let go
Now it's dragging me into your grave
For Asylum (Relive a lie)
Overcome by the feeling that I won't get to join you in time
(without you) this world is not fulfilling me

Don't make me live in Asylum
I live a lie
Don't want to live in Asylum
I live a lie
Don't make me live in Asylum
I live a lie
