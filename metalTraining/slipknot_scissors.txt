I play doctor for five minutes flat 
Before I cut my heart open...and let the air out 
Three bugs, a pound of dust 
Some wind spilled over me 
In the strangest manner that had 
Broke away my tear spout 

As I lie there 
With my tongue spread wide open 
A black widow had offered me 
A sweatheart tube 
As I injected 
The candid heart that I selected 
She said don't hesitate 
Just do what you have to do! 

It's hard to stay between the lines of skin 
Just cuz I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel 
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway 
Just let the blood run red CUZ I CAN'T FEEL! 

Biding my time until the time is right 
Biding my time until the time is right 
Biding my time until the time is right 
Biding my time... 
It's time 

It is time
