A slap in the face, it is endowed
The light of my life is put out somehow
I'm lying in pieces of emotions you control
You're feeding my sympathy the lie unfolds

Feeling this hostility, I pray
Begging, make this evil go away
Coveting the things I only fear
Building my sanctuary of blood and tears

The lines that I traced
Around the scars they swell
Implant with a sedative
To numb this spell

I'm lying in pieces of emotions you control
You're feeding this cancer
it's taken hold

Feeling this hostility, I pray
Begging, make this evil go away
Coveting the things I only fear
Building my sanctuary of blood and tears

Feeling animosity
When no one else is around
Blindly, I scream into the air
Eating my heart off the ground

Feeling this hostility, I pray
Begging, make this evil go away
Coveting the things I only fear
Building my sanctuary of blood and tears

GROOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUND!
