[Bonus Track - From the Stained Class sessions]

You'd better run
You'd better run
You'd better run from the Devil's gun

The race is on
The race is on
Now you'd better run from the Devil's gun

Strange things happen
If you stay
The Devil will catch you anyway
He'll seek you here
He'll seek you there
The Devil will seek you everywhere

And when he finds you
You'll soon find out
The Devil's fire just won't go out
He burns you up
From head to toe
The Devil's grip just won't let go
