What's the matter, baby
What a wicked smile
You look like the ghost of Cinderella
You look like you'd go a  country mile
My, my, my, my, you're coming on strong
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Gonna burn the whole world down
See me burning...

Where's the action honey?
Speak and tell me true
Even if you don't know what I'm saying
You look like you know the ones who do
My, my, my, my, you really fetch my bone
You're the one, you're the one
Shake your ass, bring it on
See me burning...

What's the matter, baby?
Don't you wanna play?
Come on over later, bring your sister,
I swear to you she won't be in the way
My, my, my, my, I wanna go for broke
Come on down, come on up
I got the magic, I can change your luck
bye bye baby, bye bye
I gotta move on down the road
Stand your ground, stand your ground
Don't forget me and I'll see you round
See me burning, see me burn
