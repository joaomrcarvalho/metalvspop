Chaos - it's just the beginning
Every promise I made I'm rescinding
Center mass in the middle of the monster
I'm getting tired of drowning the constant

Cry for help
It's debatable
The only reason that you love me is
I'm hated by all

COME ON!
Come see dysfunction
I guess we're gonna leave it
Open for discussion

WHO AM I?
Where am I going?

Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction
Maybe I'm looking for any direction

This is not my war
This is not my fight
This is something more
This is not my life
This is not my revolution
This is not my convolution
This is not my expectation
This is not my desperation

(Yeah!)

Holed up, scarred, and tamed for the hell of it
Look at me, I am the glorified malcontent
Save me, save this
All I got to do is give up
And all is forgiven
I'm sick

Of being the butt of a cosmic joke
And I don't get the punchline
A million people lined up for miles
To see the great big mouth

SHUT UP AND APOLOGIZE!

This is not my war
This is not my fight
This is something more
This is not my life

This is not my revolution
This is not my convolution
This is not my only reason to question why

Deny my existance (Erase Me)
I won't be afraid (Try Me)
I won't be unmade (Deny Me!)
