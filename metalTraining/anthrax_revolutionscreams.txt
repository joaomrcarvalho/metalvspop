Sinking the rats start to drown
Stunning
Such a beautiful violence abounds

Questions come
Easily, you got to
A world filled, with chaos and rape you got to
Hope springs
Eternally, you got to
Not from blind faith
The guilty will pay

Yeah to the wall
Revolution calls and empires fall
Yeah by any means
Revolution screams

Justice
Finding the truth that will out
Assassin
Comes from within
Or without

Questions come
Easily, you got to
A world filled, with chaos and rape you got to
Hope springs
Eternally, you got to
Not from blind faith
The guilty will pay

Yeah to the wall
Revolution calls and empires fall
Yeah by any means
Revolution screams
Ia had a dream, by any means
Revolution screams
Revolution screams

A sense of apathy
Crushed with the smallest resolve
This beautiful violence
As the powers come crumbling down

Revolution, who’s side are you on?
