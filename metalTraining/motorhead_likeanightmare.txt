I want to be there
I gotta see
I want to feel it
I want to watch you looking at me
Oh you know how I feel
When you set me free
Like a nightmare, like a nightmare babe, like a nightmare, nightmare

It's an infection
It's disease
But no reflection
It's gonna make your blood freeze
Oh you know how I feel when you set me free
Like a nightmare, like a nightmare babe,
like a nightmare, night, nightmare
