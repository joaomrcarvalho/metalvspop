Well here, babe, look at you, and you with someone else,
Turned out like all the others, leave me by myself,
That's how it works I guess, and you like all the rest
Guess I can handle it, if that's the way it is

'Cos I'm in love with rock 'n' roll, satisfies my soul
If that's how it has to be, I won't get mad
I got rock 'n' roll, to save me from the gold
And if that's all there is, it ain't so bad
Rock 'n' roll

I never been a one to have no stedy girl,
I love the way I live, runnin' round the world
I like to fool around, love to tear 'em down
And if I leave, you love to miss me when I'm gone

[Chorus]

I can't imagine growin' old with anyone
Marching to a different drum, I hear a different song
I swear I love 'em all, I don't care if they're small
I don't care if they're tall, love 'em anyway
