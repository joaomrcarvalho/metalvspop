When you feel life is bringing you down
And you see that you’re all alone
When your friends they have all run out
That is when you will know I’m the one

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
’Til the world explodes (’til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

This could be all the heaven you’ll see
Life can be wicked, mean and cold
Could this be the end of your living hell
Come with me and I’ll free your soul (hooah)

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
’Til the world explodes (’til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

Just one thing that I want you to know
You don’t need to be on your own
No more feeling left out in the cold
Take my hand and I’ll take you home

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
’Til the world explodes (’til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
’Til the world explodes (’til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (super collider yeah)

On the high road (like a super collider)
I will take you higher (like a super collider)
’Til the world explodes (like a super collider)
Super collider!
