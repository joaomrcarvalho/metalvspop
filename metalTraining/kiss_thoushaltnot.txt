I lived most of my life in New York City
Born and raised in the promised land
One day this man in black said, "Listen Jack"
Told me I was chosen to kiss the ring on his hand

He said "Kindly reconsider the sins of your past"
And I said "Mister you can kindly kiss my ass"

"Thou shalt not" -
but I know what I want - "Thou shalt not"
"Thou shalt not" -
but I know what I need - "Thou shalt not"
Well, the son of a bitch must be crazy
Tellin' me I'm gonna go down
I said, "this ain't the inquisition,
you ain't the son of God
And I sure as hell don't give a damn"

He said, "You're long gone, can't you tell?"
And I said "Mister, if I'm goin',
I'll see you in hell! Yeah!"
"Thou shalt not" -
but I know what I want - "Thou shalt not"
"Thou shalt not" -
but I know what I need - "Thou shalt not" - yeah
"Thou shalt not" -
gotta live my life - "Thou shalt not"
"Thou shalt not" -
any way I please - "Thou shalt not"
Don't even try, you know I'd die to be free, oh yeah
And you wonder why, you can't bring this guy to his knees
'Cause I know what I want, yes, I know what I need
Well, I know what I want, I know what I need
Gotta live my life just the way I please, ooh yeah

[Instrumental break]

'Cause I know what I want, yeaaahhhhh!
"Thou shalt not", "Thou shalt not"
"Thou shalt not", "Thou shalt not"
"Thou shalt not" -
but I know what I want - "Thou shalt not"
"Thou shalt not" -
oh, yes I do - "Thou shalt not"
I'm gonna live my life
any way I choose - "Thou shalt not"
You got that right.
