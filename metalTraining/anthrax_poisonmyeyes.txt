I always knew I had what it took
To jump over any obstacle
Together and separate we've been through
Fight for me, I'd kill for you

I always knew things were the same
But there's a caution light in your brain
I won't help with your cement shoes
If bailing out is what you choose

You've been spending years and years
Carrying your biggest fears too long
You've been sucked in through a whole
With your vision of control so long

If you leave your defenses down, 
Who won't pick you up?

Poison My Eyes

Better men have tried, tried to take me down
A man is a man is a man you can't see clear
Now you're forced to hear
All that you dread, better to keep it in
Believe it's what you deserve

You make me feel everything I do
Better than me, a thousand times as you
All endurances leave you behind
As you disconnect from the grind
Drowning in your own denial
It's a simple as a smile
One is strong, one insecure
Who dies first in our private war?

You've been spending years and years 
Carrying your darkest fears too long
You've been falling through a hole
Now your vision of control is gone

Be dangerous, unpredictable and make a lot of noise!

If you leave your defenses down, 
Who won't pick you up?

Poison My Eyes

Better men have tried, tried to take me down
A man is a man is a man you can't see clear
Now you're forced to hear
All that you dread, better to keep it in
Believe it's what you deserve
