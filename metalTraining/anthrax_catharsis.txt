All these years I've been the hard man
All these years it's been so hard man
To live my life for someone else
In fear of being honest with myself
I perpetrated a lie

Juggling my life with one hand
Tied behind my back, trying to find
And it had always been mine
I perpetrated a lie

I'm in, I'm out, I'm in, I'm out
I'm in, I'm out, I'm in, I'm out
I'm breaking through the darkness

And it knocked me over
Into the light of an older soul
And I'll never die
Cause everything I am is in your eyes

Angels in my heart, Devils in my eyes
Devils in my eyes...
Angels in my heart, Devils in my eyes
Devils in my eyes...

And it knocked me over
Into the light of an older soul
And I'll never die
I'll live forever in your eyes

Crucify my inhibitions
The first born son he died for my sins
Nothing to worry about
And all these years I was the hard man
I always knew I'd find myself and prove
Because you told me the truth
It's all I wanted from you

I'm in, I'm out, I'm in, I'm out
I'm in, I'm out, I'm in, I'm out
I'm breaking through the darkness

And it knocked me over
Into the light of an older soul
And I'll never die
Cause everything I am is in your eyes

Angels in my heart, Devils in my eyes
Devils in my eyes...
Angels in my heart, Devils in my eyes
Devils in my eyes...
Angels in my heart, Devils in my,
Devils in my,
Devils in my,
Devils in my eyes...

And it knocked me over
Into the light of an older soul
And I'll never die
I'll live forever in your eyes

My cathartic dream, a primal scream, shedding my skin
Somewhere between light and dark I balanced what I am
And I remember everything, we said we'd find a way
Laugh and cry, love and hate, ain't no weak link this bond can't break
I pull it out there, it comes back
I pull it out there, it comes back
I pull it out there, it comes back
I pull it out there, it comes back

Angels in my heart, Devils in my eyes
Devils in my eyes...
Angels in my heart, Devils in my eyes
Devils in my eyes...
Angels in my heart, Devils in my,
Devils in my,
Devils in my,
Devils in my eyes...

And it knocked me over
Into the light of an older soul
And I'll never die
I'll live forever in your eyes
I'll never die, I'll never die
I'll never die, I'll never die
I'll never die, I'll never die
I'll never die, I'll never die
