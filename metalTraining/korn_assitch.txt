I hate writing shit, it is so stupid
What's my problem today? 
Maybe I'm depressed, 
Maybe I'm not listening to what comes out my pen
Pain. . .Pain. . .Pain. . . 

I hate writing shit, it is so stupid 
Why do I feel this way? 
It is in my eye 
I'm in way too far 
Can't it won't go away 
Pain. . .Pain. . .Pain. . . 

Before long my song is dying! 

I hate writing shit 
Ain't looking foward to it 
What's fucked up, today? 
Writing all this time 
Feeling all that's mine 
Come right out my pen 
Pain. . .Pain. . .Pain. . . 

Before long my song is dying! 

Tell me now, I want to know 
Is it me inside you see? 
Ahh, it isn't fair 
I got a little son inside me. . .free. . . 

Set me free 
It just sets me free 
It just sets me free 

Before long my song is dying! 

That;s why I died, this lie, I try!!!
