Still can't believe it, can't stand to leave it
But I know the rules
We were doomed babe, too much too soon babe
Acting like fools

Tried to fly and climbed too high
We saw it all, we had to fall
But I swear it's true, was all for you
I swear it's true, was all for you

Making love all the time,
Never let the day go by, or a night
Sweet music in the dark
You always found the spark to light my light

[Chorus]

The only one babe, to ever break my heart
Was you, such a shame,
Though guys never cry, but that'll be the day I die,
Speaking your name

[Chorus]
