Babe
I need you again
it's getting late
i'm getting high
please let me in
Love
i give you all my love
i just need someone to hold on to
won't you let me in
Girl
you're the biggest part of me
I need you back in my arms
Girl
You're the biggest part of me
How long will you leave me out here
in the dark?

Another lonely night
back in silent town
thinkin' of ways to get you back
in my arms
Lovein' me all the love you can give
but you've got to go
i just can't live
another day
there's no other way

Girl
You're the biggest part of me
I need you back in my arms
Girl
You're the biggest part of me
How long will you leave me out here
in the dark?

It's a lonely night
feels like i'm dying inside
all i need is one more chance before I
lose my mind

Girl
You're the biggest part of me
I need you back in my arms
Girl
You're the biggest part of me
How long will you leave me out here
in the dark?
