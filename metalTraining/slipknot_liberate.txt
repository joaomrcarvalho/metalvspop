Liberate - My madness 
(One of me, all of you) 
Liberate - My madness 
I just want to... 

Section off myself 
Put a wall up/What the hell have I done 
Keep the dog at bay 
Survive by saving me! 
Values and the game 
Not a fuck-up - Not a part of your lie 
I am one, I am all - I'm above and beyond! 

Back off of the shit 
Stand off or I'll spit 
So soft, you forget 
Your garbage in is garbage out 
You don't give a shit 
I won't play the fit 
Get off, get on this 
Your garbage in is garbage out 

Liberate my madness... 

Liberate - My madness 
(One of me, all of you) 
Liberate - My madness 
I just want to... 

I am not ashamed 
What is vital, isn't always humane 
You can break in vain 
But you can't break away 
Even in my face 
Lotta bullshit, not alotta the truth 
I can't see from here 
But I can smell your fear 

Back off of the shit 
Stand off or I'll spit 
So soft, you forget 
Your garbage in is garbage out 
You don't give a shit 
I won't play the fit 
Get off, get on this 
Your garbage in is garbage out 

Saved - You're such a slave - I don't expect a 
Name - You don't care - I wasn't witness - 
I can't be a part of a system such as this 
Hard eyes - Glow right - In my - Darkness - Again 
With the sickness, rengade blisters, sisters, 
Salivate, litigate, liberate, madness, sadness 
Fuck this - How long have I had this? 
I don't need this - Outta my business 
Insert, engage, betrayed, my God 
Fraud 

Liberate - My madness 
(One of me, all of you) 
Liberate - My madness 
I just want to...
