I thought I knew what provocation was
I thought I knew what provocation was
I've eaten from the insane root that imprisons reason

It's in my stomach like fire, like cancer
Like a knife I've been gunshot
I gotta let it go

Goddamn, nowhere place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a heart so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you, I'm out

My only antidote to mental suffering
Is physical pain
I've eaten from the insane root that imprisons reason

It's in my stomach like fire
It's in my stomach like cancer
It's in my stomach like a knife
I've been gunshot
I gotta let it go

Goddamn, nowhere place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a heart so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you, I'm out

Goddamn, nowhere place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a heart so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you, I'm out, out, out

Goddamn, nowhere place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a heart so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you, I'm out

Goddamn, nowhere place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a heart so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you, I'm out, out, out, out, OUT!!
