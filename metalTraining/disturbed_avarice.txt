Politics and evil
All one in the same
Satan hides behind a different name

[Chorus:]
Take these chains away
Free my hands from bondage
Can't explain away
Avarice will kill you in time

Violent upheaval
Cities drenched in flame
Wickedness we know we can contain

[Chorus]

Who will we murder now
See what we are becoming
An onyx veil that filters out the light
I'll savour this anger
My hate makes me stronger

Free my hands from bondage
Take these chains away
Running from destruction
Avarice will kill you in time
