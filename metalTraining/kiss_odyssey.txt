From a far off galaxy, I hear you calling me
we are on an odyssey
Through the realms of time and space
In that enchanted place
You and I come face to face

Once upon not yet, long ago someday
Countless times we've met, met along the way

Through the luminescent night
On beams of neon light
You and I in wing-ged flight
As we cross the starry sea, powered by what we see
Now and then, the victory

[Chorus]

There's a child in a sundress
Looking at a rainy sky
There's a place in the desert
Where an ocean once danced by
There's a song in the silence
Weaving in and out of time
We are notes in the music
Searching for remembered rhyme

On a mountain high somewhere
Where only heroes dare
Stand the stallion and the mare
We have been and we shall be each other's destiny
One another's odyssey

[Chorus]

We've met along the way....
We've met along the way
