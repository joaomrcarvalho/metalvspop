This is the year where hope fails you
The test subjects run the experiments
And the bastards you know, is the hero you hate
But cohesing is posssible if we strive
Theres no reason, theres no lesson
No time like the present, telling you right now
What have you got to lose, what have you got to lose
Except your soul...who's with us!

I fight for the unconventional
My right, and its unconditional
I can only, be as real as i can
The disadvantage is
I never knew the plan
This isn't the way just to be a martyr
I cant, walk alone any longer
I fight, for the ones who can't fight
And if I lose, at least I tried

We, we are the new diabolic
We, we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life you can have it
We, we are the pulse of the maggots

I won't, be the inconsequential
I won't, be the wasted potential
I can make it, as severe as I can
Until you realize
You'll never take a stand
It isn't, just a one-sided version
We've dealt, with a manic subversion
And I won't, let the truth be perverted
And I won't leave another victim deserted

We, we are the new diabolic
We, we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life you can have it
We, we are the pulse of the maggots

Say it again say it again (we won't die)
Say it again say it again (we won't die)
Say it again say it again (we won't die)
Say it again say it again (we won't die)
Say it again say it again (we won't die)
Say it again say it again (we won't die)
Say it again say it again (we won't die)
Say it again say it again (we won't die)

We fight til no one can fight us
We live, and no one can stop us
We pull when we're pushed too far
And the advantages is
The bottom line is
We never, had to fight in the first place
We only, had to spit back at their face
We won't, walk alone any longer
What doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger

We, we are the new diabolic
We, we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life you can have it
We, we are the pulse of the maggots

Do you understand (yes)
Do you understand (yes)
Do you understand (yes)

Say it again say it again (we won't die)
Say it again say it again (we won't die)
Say it again say it again (we won't die)
Say it again say it again (we won't die)
