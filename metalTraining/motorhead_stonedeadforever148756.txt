You think you see me in the glass
You think you hear me you better listen fast
I think I see you gone to seed
The only reason was your guilt and greed
you're out there on your own
Your face has turned to stone
Whatever happened to your life
Stone dead forever.

It's been a long time
And a long long wait
And you caught your fingers in the pearly gates
You better leave your number
And we'll call you
You know your problems they ain't exactly new
The dark side of the road
And it's your time to go
Whatever happened to your life
Stone dead forever

You're a financial wizard, a top tycoon
Sweet lounge lizard with a silver spoon
You know you've never had it quite so good
And you didn't know that you even could
But your time has come today
Your feet turn to clay
Whatever happened to your life
Stone dead forever.
