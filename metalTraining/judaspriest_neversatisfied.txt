[Downing/Halford]

Where do we go from here
There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever
Places change, faces change

Life is so very strange
Changing time, changing rhyme together
There's nowhere else to go...
This could be or last show
Changing dreams changing schemes... NEVER

We're never satisfied
Love is gone along with fun
Now we're reaching for the gun
Changing cast, changing fast
No more tether
We are never satisfied
