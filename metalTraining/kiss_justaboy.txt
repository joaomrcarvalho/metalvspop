Who steers the ship through the stormy sea
If hope is lost then so are we

While some eyes search for one to guide us
Some are staring at me

But I'm no hero
Though I wish I could be
For I am just a boy,
Too young to be sailing
I am just a boy,
And my future is unveiling
And I'm so frightened of failing
