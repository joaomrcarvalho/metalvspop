I'm ethereal, my children are legion, serial 
They stick to my skin like beloved cysts 
I tear away with my nails and teeth and fists
Touch the hands of inverted saints 
Follow my heart through the threaded pain 
Callow man is a sentinel screaming 
I see the future; the future is bleeding 

Sores, every goddamn minute I can feel 'em now 
Like a virus, you will never kill me now 
Goin' underground, comin' on like hepatitis 
We're out - and you can't reshape us 
Another bug in the construct 
Tearin' up the main bus B 
Zeros and ones are everything - execute me 

Everywhere you look, it's like they know 
Their fingerprints are hidden by CONTROL 
This is where the line is drawn, see 
YOU CAN'T TAKE MY SOUL AWAY FROM ME 

What do you need to see? Ya feel the impact? 
Gotta retract - everybody get back 
What is this? It's like a big conspiracy 
Fields of dejected morbid progeny 
They always say that it's always our fault 
But everything we say is taken with a grain of salt 
Man, it's always the same, if we talk or complain 
We only wanna upset the balance 
How's it feel to be the New Abortioin? 
The only generation to suffer extortion 

Everywhere you look, it's like they know 
Their fingerprints are hidden by CONTROL 
This is where the line is drawn, see 
YOU CAN'T TAKE MY SOUL AWAY FROM ME 

YOU CAN'T TAKE MY SOUL AWAY FROM ME
