Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please, no 

Grandma take me home [x7]
Wanna be alone 

Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatos and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good 

Grandma take me home [x7]
Wanna be alone 

Said, why don't you stop your crying
Go outside and ride your bike
Thats what I did, I killed my toe 

Grandma take me home [x7]
Wanna be alone 

After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep, and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms 

Grandma take me home [x16]
Never take me home [x2]
Grandma take me home

Wanna be alone
