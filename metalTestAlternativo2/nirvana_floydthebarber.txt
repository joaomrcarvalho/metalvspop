Bell on door clanks - come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down (in the) chair, don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face

I'm ashamed [x3]

Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see, I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip
Pee-Pee pressed against my lips

I was shamed [x3]

I sense others in the room
Opie Aunt Bee, I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I die smothered in Andy's clutch

I was shamed [x3]
