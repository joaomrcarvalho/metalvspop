Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching teardrops in my hands
Only silence as it痴 ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like there痴 nothing left of me?

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I知 made of glass
Like I知 made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

As the smoke clears, I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
To watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken
But I知 standing on my feet

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I知 made of glass
Like I知 made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

Go run run run
I知 gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear
Go run run run
Yeah, it痴 a long way down
But I am closer to the clouds up here

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I知 made of glass
Like I知 made of paper, oh
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
(Like a skyscraper)
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
