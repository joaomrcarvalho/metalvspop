Broken again
I知 down on my knees ripped apart
But I see you out there
So I知 taking these chains off my heart

I知 listening close for you
Feeling my way out the dark
I知 on my way to you
And won't nothing keep me from you

So I値l just free run,
'til my feet start to lift off the ground
I will just free run,
'til I find myself right where you are, oh
Whoa, whoa, I値l free run to you
Whoa, whoa, free run to you

Life with you leaving,
Is like being locked upside down
I知 all out of reasons to let
All this hurt keep me bound

I値l listen close for you
I don稚 wanna miss the good parts
I知 on my way to you
And wont nothing keep me from you

So I値l just free run,
'til my feet start to lift off the ground
I will just free run,
'til I find myself right where you are, oh
Whoa, whoa, I値l free run to you
Whoa, whoa, free run to you

So I値l just free run,
'til my feet start to lift off the ground
I will just free run,
'til I find myself right by your side, oh
Whoa, whoa, I値l free run to you
Whoa, whoa, free run to you
