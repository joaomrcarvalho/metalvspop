[Dre]
Departure time 7:30
I'm packed and ready to go
First class ticket outta here
I think it's time,
To put it back in gear,
No more standing by,
I'm tryin to stay clear

[Chris]
Turbulence got me nervous,
I should have never flown
Scared when you
Fly alone again
You know the atmosphere
Wasn't perfect
I'm thinkin to myself
Was it worth it

[Dre]
Layover's almost over
I can see clearly,
No more stormy weather
Exit row,
Don't pull on
The lever, lever
This gon be
My final destination

[Chris]
No more sittin round
Havin my time wasted

You say it's now or never
I pick never
We can be together,
So calm down
No more red eye late nights
I'm one way,
No more connected flights (when...)

[Chris: Chorus]
When we stared out knew
I knew this relationship 
Was unhealthy
You broke the code,
Never thought
That you would stoop so low
(You got me flyin solo)
Now you cryin talkin bout you
Can't live without me yeah
My heart is sold
Shoulda never ever left me this cold
You got me flying solo
Solo solo
Solo solo solo
Solo solo solo
You got me flyin
You got me flyin solo
Solo solo
Solo solo solo
Solo solo solo

[Chris]
Touchin' down 11:30
I'm rushing
Through the doors
I'm in a good place now
Can't find my baggage
And I don't even want it back
And I don't wanna have you no more

I don't need to carry on
It's gonna weight me down
You didn't think
That I would find out
Whether or not
Who is wrong or right
I can't talk now,
I gotta catch another flight

[Dre]
Layover's almost over,
I can see clearly,
No more stormy weather
Exit row, don't pull
On the lever, lever
This gon be
My final destination

[Chris]
No more sittin round
Havin my time wasted

You say it's now or never
I pick never
We can be together,
So calm down
No more red eye late nights
I'm one way,
No more connected flights

You got me flyin solo
Solo solo
Solo solo solo
Solo solo solo

Thought i was scared to fly
Without you here
Now you can't get
Under my skin
Like you did before
Why
I was so reluctant
To walk out on us
So now I'm taking
Back my life
Goodbye
