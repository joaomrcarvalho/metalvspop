When someone becomes nothing to anyone
Wilts feelings have died
Anyone would know it
They set out stick and stones
They say they crossed my bones
I say I don’t get mad I get even
before they do.

Spoils go to the victor
I’m dead on time
Your time is going to come

One day I’ll dance on your graves
Even if you’re buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge
I’ll tell them you’re dead to me

We’re all just trying to hold on to anything
You’d think they’d know that’s what we’re trying to do
These wounds are invisible

Underneath the dirt I still see the scars
But then when things got bad we spread our wings and fly away

You’ll take all your riches in the back of a hearse
Your time is going to come

One day I’ll dance on your graves
Even if you’re buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge
I’ll tell them you’re dead to me

One day I’ll dance on your grave
Even if you’re buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge

One day I’ll dance on your graves
Even if you’re buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge
I’ll tell them you’re dead to me
