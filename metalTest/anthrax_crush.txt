Now you see me, now you don't
Go before I am the goat
You get away with murder
Kill me when you're through
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you
You get away with murder
What do I have to do
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you

From the smallest taste I use
From the smallest taste I lose
Won't you crush on me

Pile your dead on top of me
Tape my eyes so I can't see

You get away with murder
Kill me when you're through
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you
You get away with murder
What do I have to do
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you

From the smallest taste I use
From the smallest taste I lose
Won't you crush on me

I've been waiting for today
I can't touch you when you're far away
Nothing makes me feel this way
Except hate but that fades away

From the smallest taste I use
From the smallest taste I lose

Won't you crush on me

I've been waiting for today
I can't touch you when you're far away
Nothing makes me feel this way
Except hate but that fades away
