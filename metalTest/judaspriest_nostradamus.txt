They never broke my will
Cause my heart was strong
They won't justify
Condemnation, my vindication
But I will survive

Stood my ground 'till the end
Engaged the enemy protect my friends

Nostradamus [x2]

Tamed the beast
They sent to kill
The congregation never broke my will

Nostradamus [x2]

He has overcome
He can take the throne

Nostradamus; vindication
Nostradamus; is avenged

Nostradamus; our salvation
Nostradamus; he's avenged

I walked through fire to justify
Their inquisitions all condemned to die

Nostradamus [x2]

Adversity on which I thrived
Destroys the altar now I'm vilified

Nostradamus [x2]

He has seized the day
He is here to stay

Nostradamus; vindication
Nostradamus; is avenged

Nostradamus; our salvation
Nostradamus; he's avenged

Vindication,
He has been avenged

They never broke my will
Because my heart was strong
They can't justify
I will survive

He has overpowered
It's his finest hour

Nostradamus; vindication
Nostradamus; is avenged

Nostradamus; our salvation
Nostradamus; he's avenged

Nostradamus [x4]
