I wanna grow my hair, live in Bel Air,
Lose my head, keep live snake in my bed,
I wanna backstage pass,
Drink Bon Jovi's booze for free,
I wanna be a star
And buy a hundred guitars,
Eat everything I can bite,
I wanna feel a little danger,
Feel a little stranger,
Angel City tonight,
I got a buncha boys,
We make a lot of noise,
Little bit crazy,
Playing with chemical toys,
We're such bad ass dudes,
Almost can't stand it myself,
I wanna get the crabs
In my elegant rags,
Make my mom & daddy uptight,
I wanna be an intellectual,
Heterosexual, Angel City tonight,
I'm gonna live in L.A. drinkin' all day,
Lay by the pool
And let the record company pay,
Talking to the devil on the batphone
All of the time,
I'm gonna kick ass,
I'm gonna spit broken glass,
I'm gonna shoot out all of your lights,
I wanna eat dirt,
I'm gonna eat my own shirt,
Angel City tonight,
Angel City [2]
The way I'm used is a shame and a pity
Angel City [2] rock'n'roll alright,
Angel City [2]
The women here ain't got no pity,
Angel City [2] shape up and fly right.
