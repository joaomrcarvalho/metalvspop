What goes on behind closed doors,
private wounds, open sores
You're your own worst enemy
and cheap thrills bring you to your knees
It's thumbs down for someone you know,
and it's easy come and easy go

[Chorus:]
Burn your bridges, take what you can get
Go for the throat 'cause you paid your debt
Livin' well is the best revenge, so give 'em hell

While the city sleeps -
it's all there in black and white
While the city sleeps -
through the eye of the needle, gotta thread your life
While the city sleeps -
while the city sleeps
It's a hit or miss, an eye for an eye,
live for today, and don't ask why
For better or worse, you bought and sold
They love you while you're hot
and leave you when you're cold

[chorus]

While the city sleeps -
yeah, better run for your life
Take your troubles to the night
While the city sleeps -
yeah, beggars, thieves and losers, there's no relief
While the city sleeps -
there's no relief, while the city sleeps
While the city sleeps - yeah

[chorus]

While the city sleeps - while the city sleeps
While the city sleeps - while the city sleeps
yeah, there's no relief
