As I walk down the highway, all I do is sing this song
And a train that's passing my way helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about the words, they're clear
The voice is strong, it's oh-so strong

I am just a simple guy, I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown and blows my blues away
There's nothing more that I can say, but on a day like today
I pass the time away and walk a quiet mile with you

All I need from you, is all your love
All you gotta give to me, is all your love
All I need from you, is all your love
All you gotta give to me, is all your love

I'm so glad I'm living, gonna tell the world that I am
I got me a fine woman and she says that I'm her man
One thing that I know for sure, gonna give her all the loving like nobody can

Standing in the noonday sun, trying to flag a ride
People go and people come, see my rider right by my side
It's a total disgrace that they set the pace, it must be a race
And the best thing I can do is run

All I need from you, is all your love
All you gotta give to me, is all your love
All I need from you, is all your love
All you gotta give to me, is all your love
