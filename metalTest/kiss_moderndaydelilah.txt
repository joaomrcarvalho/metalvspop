[Verse]
I still remember when I saw your face across the room
Told me to take you but the price of love would seal my doom

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the way you made the others break
But loving me would be your first mistake

[Chorus]
Same old way, same old ways
Modern Day Delilah
Each time you learn to give
Queen to slave
Modern Day Delilah

Listen

[Verse]
You lived your glory in a liars haze you called the truth
The same old story of a social plan from wasted youth

[Pre-Chorus]
You thought that you could bring me to my knees
But whos the one whos crying baby please

[Chorus]
Same old way, same old ways
Modern Day Delilah
Each time you learn to give
Queen to slave
Modern Day Delilah

[Bridge]
Just like the trigger of a loaded gun
You were the reason for the damage done
Too many lovers like a hunters prey
Not today

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the way you made the others break
But loving me would be your last mistake
Each time you learn to give

[Chorus]
Same old ways
Modern Day Delilah
Shame, shame, shame on you girl
Queen to slave, come on now
Modern Day Delilah
Yeah, yeah, each time you learn to give
Same old way, same old ways
Not today
Delilah
Queen to slave, loves decayed
Delilah
