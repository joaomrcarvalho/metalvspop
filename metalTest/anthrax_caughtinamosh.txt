Why don't you listen to me when I try to talkto you
Stop thinking of yourself, for just a second fool
Shut up, shut up, I don't wanna hear your mouth
Your mather made a monster, now get the hell out of my house

[BRIDGE:]
Can't stand it for another day
I ain't gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Stomp, stomp, stomp, the idiot convention

[PRE-CHORUS:]
Which one of these words don't you understand ?
Talking to you, is like clapping with one hand

[CHORUS:]
What is it ? - Caught in a mosh
What is it ? - Caught in a mosh
What is it ? - Caught in a mosh
What is it ? - Caught in a mosh

Don't tell me how to do my job
There's the door, your name's on the knob
You're always in the way, like a beast on my back
Were you dropped as a baby, cause brains you lack

[REPEAT BRIDGE]
[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]
[REPEAT CHORUS]

[MOSH PART]
Think - before you speak
Or suffer, for your words
Learn, to give respect
that others, give to you
AAAAAAAAAAAH, The best you can do

[LEAD BREAK]
[HARMONY LEAD]

Hey Man
I'm trying to reason but you don't understand
Talking in circles, we'll never get it straight
Just you and me in our theatre of hate

[REPEAT BRIDGE]
[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]
[REPEAT CHORUS]
