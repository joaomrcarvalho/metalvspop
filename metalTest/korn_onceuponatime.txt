Feeling really out of place
Simply have too much time
Alone for a lifetime searching for
Things I will never find
I am here to take
Whatever I feel is mine
I'm feeling like I'm never needed
Walking alone blind...
Once upon a time
I never thought I'd end up dead
Horrid thoughts dance in my head
From time to time
Oh once upon a time
Feeling like I'm on a plane that's going down.
Looking at another face
Looking for another sign
Alone in my bed wasted without fear
Waiting for my time
Once upon a time
I never thought I'd end up dead
Horrid thoughts dance in my head
From time to time
Oh once upon a time
Feeling like I'm on a plane that's going down.
I don't understand here
Why God would do me this way
I've lived a life
Was always good
The one thing I need, ya take away
Ya take away
(The one thing) take away
(The one thing) take away
(The one thing) take away
(The one thing) take away (YA TAKE AWAY!)
(The one thing) take away (YA TAKE AWAY!)
(The one thing) take away (YA TAKE AWAY!)
AWAY!
AWAY!
Ya took away my world
All ya left was pain
And all this time is for nothing
Once upon a time
I never thought I'd end up dead
Horrid thoughts dance in my head
From time to time
Oh once upon a time
Feeling like I'm on a plane that's going down.
