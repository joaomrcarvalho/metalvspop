It's strange to be around again
Can't kill the bad disguise
I was asking for it all,
Being dragged down the road
Call it wisdom
call it ignorance

But it's still alive
And it's in me now
And it lives and breathes
I can't give a fuck

I've got a big mouth
And there's a life to live
From a bottle of whiskey
It's where you come from
(the south)

A remedy to the curse
On harder wares control
Look at what's around
But I just can't lie around
Feeling sorry for myself

But it's still alive
And it's in me now
And it lives and breathes
I could care less

I've got a big mouth
And there's a life to live
From the weight of whiskey
It's where you come from
It's where you come from

Bottle of Whiskey

I fell in front of my friends
I dropped out in front of the world
You call that supernatural?
It ain't

I've got a big mouth
And there's a life to live
From a bottle of whiskey
It's where (the south)

Black wings will weather your flight
For some there's no second time
Following paths of your life
I stepped off the mountain to the sky

Watch your ass now
It's where you come from
Why'd you settle down?
It's where you come from
Where you come from
Why'd you ask them?
It's where you come from
