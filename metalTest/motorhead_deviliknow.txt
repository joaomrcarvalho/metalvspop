Stand up for the cause,
Lay down for the law,
You know what your claw is for,
Far as you can spit,
Don't knock on my door,
You ain't welcome no more,
I might be a dog,
But honey, you're a bitch.

Ain't gonna change a thing,
Ain't gonna change my ways,
I don't care where you've been,
I don't care where you go,
Going back to the devil I know.

Stand up for the count,
Hold up and dismount,
I know what my feet are for,
I know when to quit,
Don't come around my house,
Or I'll put you out,
It might sound harsh,
But I'm done flicking your switch.

Ain't gonna change a thing,
Ain't gonna change my ways,
I don't care where you've been,
I don't care where you go,
Going back to the devil I know, Hey.

Stand up for your life,
Lay down for the knife,
I know what that smile is for,
Hard as I been hit,
I can't be your lover,
So go find another,
It might sound cold,
But I'm done digging your ditch.

Ain't gonna change a thing,
Ain't gonna change my ways,
I don't care where you've been,
I don't care where you go,
Going back to the devil I know.
