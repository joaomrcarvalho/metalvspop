Don't know what's been goin' on in your head, no
When you knew that his love was through
You closed your eyes instead
I was there with a shoulder to lean on
It's not gonna happen twice
If you go I just want you to know, it's alright

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

Did you think it would open up in the night, yeah
Just pretend I'm only a friend and disappear from sight
One day you're gonna be lonely, wishin' I was by your side
And one day you'll think of me only
But girl, you gotta take the ride
Well too bad, now that the damage is done

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

Little girl, gonna make your bed in the night, yeah
Now you say, "You're goin' away"
But I will keep your heart
And you will cry when you realize you were wrong
Run on, run on

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run, no
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
