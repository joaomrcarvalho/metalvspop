We should have got it on, you know it's true,
So many times, I thought I spoke to you,
But I guess it wasn't true, some dreams ain't real,
Wishful thinking, the way I feel,
But you sure looked good this time,
I'm sure it ain't no crime,
A little fantasy, involving you & me.

Cone on Over, lay it down,
It's about time, shoot me a line, lay it down,
All of our lives, running away from the law,
We all live under the sun,
But we don't have to live under the gun.

We still might meet again, you know we could,
I got so many ways, to make you feel so good,
I guess it's up to you, to make it work,
I hope it's true, don't leave me in the dirt,
You sure look good to me, I'm sure you must agree.
Just one more chance, the horizontal dance.

And so we're warm again, perhaps a little wet,
I know a few good ways, make sure you don't forget,
I guess it's real right now, let me show you how,
Some dreams come true, got me next to you,
Can't wait to see, you naked just for me,
Move against me girl, take me around the world.

Cone on Over, lay it down,
It's about time, shoot me a line, lay it down,
All of our lives, running away from the law,
We all live under the sun,
But we don't have to live under the gun.
