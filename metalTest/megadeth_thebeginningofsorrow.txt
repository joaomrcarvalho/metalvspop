Beginning of Sorrow
There'll be no tomorrow
Beginning of Sorrow

Easy prey, so innocent
She barely was a teen
Hooked up with Mr. Right now
A nightmare that stole her dreams
Complications come
The Doctor says you gotta know
You decide if the baby lives
But one of you has got to go

The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow, There'll be no tomorrow
The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow

Brought forth in agony
This life was misbegot
Born in an alleyway
A child nobody will adopt
Delinquent in a foster home
His heart is so full of rage
His first name's "Ward"
His last name is "Of the State"

Origo doloris non erit crastinus dies

Like father, like son
Soon he gets revenge
Two souls soon become one
The vicious cycle never ends
Unwanted, unloved
He lives now just to hate
From the pain of being born
And nothing can take that away

The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow, There'll be no tomorrow
The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow...
