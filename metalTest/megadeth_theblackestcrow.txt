This cold, empty house is
So quiet now she's gone
The dust accumulates into
Mountains on the ground

My paper's piled on the steps
Her flowers all have died
I'm searching everywhere
For someone I'll never find

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
It's too late, when you've lost your soul
I left her everything, she only left my ring
My world is darker now than the blackest crow

[Slide - Dave]

Shadows fill this place
She's been away so long
The wallpaper leaves a stain
Where pictures once belonged

You think I would have known
Something was going on
Her kisses were so cold
Her loving touch withdrawn

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
It's too late, when you've lost your soul
I left her everything, she only left my ring
My world is darker now than the blackest crow

[Solo - Dave]

They never do teach you how to walk away from someone that you love

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
I know t's too late, when you've lost your soul
The fires all but gone, my world is darker now
Than the blackest crow

[Slide - Dave]

The blackest crow...
