[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

In the cities of the world
You know every boy and girl
Goes crazy to the beat of rock n' roll
And as the volume is soaring
All the crowd is roaring
Let it roll

Well, we don't care in the least
Cause our metal is a feast
But there's always someone trying to put it down
So we crank the music louder
And our voices turn to power
With a wall of sound we'll blow 'em all away

Rock you all around the world
We're gonna rock
We're gonna roll
We're gonna shake you down
We're gonna lose control

No one can hold us down
Just look around and see
This generation's getting up and breakin' free
