[Verse 1]
Feelings you see.
Are so hard to believe.
All the chaos I have in my heart.
Devils I make and the love can relate.
All the solace inside tears me up.

Take me away!
Set me on fire!
There's no other way!

[Chorus]
Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain.
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained.
I'm so lost and lonely now.

[Verse 2]
We've been deceived.
It's so easy for me.
'Cause the loathing I've had from the start.
Evil disease all the hatred it breathes.
As I'm down on my knees torn apart.

Take me away!
Set me on fire!
There's no other way!

[Chorus]
Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain.
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained.
I'm so lost and lonely now.

Where do I run!?
Where do I hide!?
Give me a reason to end my life! 

Where do I run!?
Where do I hide!?
Give me a reason to get out alive!

[Chorus]
Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain.
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained.
I'm so lost and lonely now.

Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain.
So what am I doing now?
(What am I doing now?)
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained.
I'm so lost and lonely now.
