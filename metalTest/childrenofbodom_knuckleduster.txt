Just, say one rude thing to me
And I'll make you see
The real fucking bitch you’ve been
You, you’ve never seen the ditch
I oughtta show you it
In the gutter I'm a kill the fucking bitch
Go!
So, you better step back
'Cause I ain't gonna be
There while you’re falling back on me
When, what all I’ve said is shown
To you a truer form
I know you’re comin’ here to die

And I will knock down
The need to gather hope
I'll take it to me
Let's slow this fucker down

(Hey!) Do you ever let go? Support my drive (Please!)
If I tell, knuckleduster beat you six feet under
(So!) Sure to kill is what they say and I swear you’ll see the day
Then I will, knuckleduster beat you six feet under

And I will knock down
The need to gather hope
I'll take it to me
You’re gonna be, sealing your fate

(Hey!) Do you ever let go? Support my drive (Please!)
If I tell, knuckleduster beat you six feet under
(So!) Sure to kill is what they say and I swear you’ll see the day
Then I will, knuckleduster beat you six feet under
