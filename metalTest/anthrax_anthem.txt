Know your place in life is where you want to be
Don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me
You keep on looking forward...no use in looking 'round
Hold your head above the ground and they won't bring you down

Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind
Yes we marvel after those who sought
The wonders of the world, wonders of the world
Wonders of the world they wrought

Live for yourself...there's no one else
More worth living for
And begging hands and bleeding hearts will only cry out for more

Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind
Yes we marvel after those who sought
The wonders of the world, world they wrought

[Solo]

Well, I know they've always told you
Selfishness was wrong
Yet it was for me, not you, I came to write this song

Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind
Yes we marvel after those who sought
The wonders of the world, world they wrought
