Pain - made to order
Pain - made to order
Pain - made to order
Pain - made to order

I'm not the second coming, I'm the first wave
Better get an army, cuz the fire left me unscathed
You betcha bottom dollar I'm the top of the shit pile
So stick around cuz I'll get to you in just a few
Step off the achtung, get back or get stung
Idiotic sense of yourself, are you that dumb?
Entire legion of me, totalitarian
The one and only muthafucka, top of the world man

Cuz I can't stand it, planned it, gonna crash land it
In other words, consider me branded
Another version of me, another version of you
Both barrels - what you gonna do?

All I hear is human noise
You made your own fuckin' choice
I belong to only me
Silence for my revelry

I can only die over time
Filthy hands, stay away from mine
Every reason is a right to hate
Painful clutch - death is fine, gimme mine

Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away

Somebody explain this
You don't care cuz you don't exist
What the fuck is this another joke?
Reckoning!

Only one of us walks away [x8]
