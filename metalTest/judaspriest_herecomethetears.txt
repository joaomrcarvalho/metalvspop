[Halford/Tipton]

Once I dreamed that love would come and sweep me up away
Now it seems life's passed me by, I'm still alone today
Here come the tears

Looks like it'll always be the same
No one here to comfort me
Here come the tears

All alone, no one cares.
So much to give to you all out there.

Take me now, in your arms.
Let me rest, safe from harm.

Ohhh.... I want to be loved...
I need to be loved...
Won't somebody love me....

Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...

Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...

[repeat two more times in background]

Here come the tears...
Here come the tears...
Here come the tears...
Here come the tears...
Here come the tears, ohhh
Here come the tears, ohhh
Here come the tears
