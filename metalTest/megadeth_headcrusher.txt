[Solo - Dave]

It's time to take your last walk in this world before your journey begins underground.
Not before we torment you from your cell straight to hell with a short detour in-between.
Begging for mercy all alone, unable to handle the pressure.
Before his mortification!
Now let the torture begin!

Death by the head crusher
Head crusher!
Death by the head crusher!

The horrific torture device for those who fail interrogation,
The most painful technique ever known,
People thirst for the worst, the skulls disintegration.
Beaten, broken, in bloody rags
Adding insult to injury, he recants
But it's much too late.
Now let the torture begin!

Death by the head crusher
Head crusher!
Death by the head crusher!

On your knees, prisoner, take your position
Place your chin forward into the restraint
Your head slowly caves in from the compression
You fade in a blackout from the infernal pain

Twisting, turning the giant screw
Your teeth are breaking loose
Crushed and splintering into your mouth

Winding down, cutting through
Like broken glass being chewed
The fragmented skull and shattering bones

There's nothing you can do.
