Woke up dead, you know I woke up dead
Give me time to get it through my head
They hanged me by the neck, I heard the devil laugh
I was a nervous wreck, I was the first in line

Do you want to look right in the devil's face?
You must have seen the ground where we upheld the Law
I was a young man then, I was a young man then
Spending time on the killing floor
Do as you would want to be
Joy of labour, sets you free

Woke up scared, you know I woke up scared
Give me time to show you, how I wound up there
They put me in a cell, I heard the ghost in there
I wasn't feeling well, I was the first in line

Do you want see right through the devil's eyes?
You must have seen the ground where they all stood before
I was a young man then, I was a young man then
Spending time on the killing floor
Be more than you seem to be
Joy of labour, sets you free

Woke up dead, you know I woke up dead
I was the only one, that saw the road ahead
They beat me with their fists
I did the devil's work
And I was on their list, I was the first in line

Do you even know what the devil does
He drives a man 'til he can't take no more
I was a young man then, I was a young man then
Spending time on the killing floor
