I found session, betrayed now, it's on now,
I saw, human, I see so
Well I am certain of, I don't know how,
other souls beyond this smile

I hate you from the bottom of my heart
I have no fucking right now, I see so

Beside you, I saw some ignition
other souls beyond this smile
Well I thought now, I said I saw (?),
I saw it, your vanity, your mentality for sure!

[Chorus:]
Never seen the fooled beast inside of me,
well I'm an asshole, and I really will always be
So why now, oh let it be,
is that so fucking hard, oh be dead, I'm free

Burn it hard, make a void that sucks to the suction drive
We need the open thing with my special little part of life

(I tell you!)

I'm accessing in all the northern light,
you know I got no fucking other souls, guilty now
I've got no fine, no fucking thoughts, so,
a combination, now you're fucking dead

[Chorus:]
Never seen the fooled beast inside of me,
well I'm an asshole, and I really will always be
So why now, let it be,
is that so fucking hard, be dead, I'm free
