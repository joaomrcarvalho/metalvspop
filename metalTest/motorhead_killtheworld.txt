Out of the way, you're in the lost and found
Been a long time waiting 'til we hit the ground
See the fool, loose it all,
Ain't no lifetime long enough to use it all
You say it's here tomorrow, gone today,
Tell the judge its my way or the highway.
And in the end it's all the same.

[CHORUS]
You got to move, momma didn't raise no fools,
You got to fight, live or die shoot out the lights,
Pass the word,
Save yourself and kill the world,
Save yourself and kill the world

We got to get you home because you're burned out,
Didn't take too long before we found it out,
See the drowned, drink it all,
Ain't no ocean deep enough to sink it all,
You say it's here right now and gone before,
Tell the hand we're harder than a hardcore,
And in the end it's all a game.

[CHORUS]

So now your back, I hope you know your place,
Didn't take too long to get in your face,
See the burned, light your fire,
Ain't no Hell that burns enough for my desire,
You say its blasphemy, that's too bad,
Could be the best time that you ever had,
And in the end, the hungry flames.

[CHORUS]
