[Downing/Halford]

Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Wide open minded,but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said i was there
Lead to positions by stern faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face

Then with an arm raised the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
A selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
And every few moments I see a friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle we are all led

Killer, killer, you keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying every single day,
Is this the way that you get your fun slaying, waylaying in the heat of the midday sun,
Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob.
You make me sick getting paid for murder,

But you wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh, no
You'll never ever dream to hurt her.
Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds 'cause you won't go to hell.
Take your medal, wear it now with pride.
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside.
