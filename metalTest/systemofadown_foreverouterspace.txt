The fortress of forever
Been forsaken
Man made promise
Polluted with blue dye
Air, water, design
Man made promise
Polluted with blue dye

Can we tamper
We have gained
Outer space, outer space
A million years
The devistation of
Outer space, outer space

Can we tamper
We have gained
Outer space, outer space
That's not true
that's not true
the human race, the human race

Polluted with blue dye

Fortress of forever
Been mistaken
Man made promise
Polluting of the sky [x2]

The fortress of forever
Been forsaken
