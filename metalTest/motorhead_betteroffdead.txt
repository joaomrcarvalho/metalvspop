Don't you believe in me now?
Now that you found a new friend
Anything goes but the truth
Messages we never send

Anything goes when the angels sing
Dance on volcanoes
Wait see what tomorrow brings
Better of dead, better of dead
Better of dead, than your ass in a sling

Why can't you open the door?
I got the key in my hand
I guess we're breaking the law
I guess I don't understand

Anything goes, but I must refuse
Show me some action
Wait 'til you see the news
Better of dead, better of dead

What is the problem here
Get with the program
Why do you stand accused
Better of dead, better of dead
Better of dead
Like to see you walk a mile in my shoes

What is the voice we don't hear
Is it still talking to you
I hope it's speaking real clear
I hope it's pulling you through
Anything goes, but I have to be fair
Teach you a lesson
Wait 'til I know you care
Better of dead, better of dead
Come and dance in your wheelchair
Show me some traction

Let me know when you get there
Better of dead, better of dead, better of dead
Keep all your love in your head
