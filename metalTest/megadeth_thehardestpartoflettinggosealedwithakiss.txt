[The Hardest Part Of Letting Go]

Such a pretty face, radiant
I saw you, across the room
I knew I had to have you

Thus started the chase
I knew I would do anything to take
Your hand and make you mine

But I learned long ago
If you love someone you have to let it go
The hardest part of letting go
Is saying goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

[Sealed With A Kiss]

Fettered away in a makeshift cell
Beneath the venomous moonlight
I unleash my plan to watch you fail
The one I held so high

Go to sleep my love
Taste my sweet revenge on your lips
Its sealed with a kiss

[Solo - Chris]

I return to the masquerade ball
And leave the long figure weeping
Stone by stone, immured in the wall
Forever left in safekeeping

Go to sleep my love
Taste my sweet revenge on your lips
Its sealed with a kiss

[The Hardest Part Of Letting Go... (Continued)]

But I learned long ago
If you love someone you have to let it go
Let it go, let it go
The hardest part of letting go
Is saying goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
