Alright!

Hey what's the matter with you,
What are you trying to do, I'm wrecking my brain
I'll never get it. Did I ever hurt you in any way?
If I did then hear my apology: FUCK YOU!

I'd give anything to batter you down,
All the way to 6 feet under
And why in earth should I stop until
I see your fucking ass drop

Mind your own business and leave mine alone,
Take a look at the real world for a sec.
It's a hell for heroes and heaven for fools,
What makes you the luckiest bastard on the earth!

In the prejudiced mind narrow yourself in,
I'm the servant while you're the king.

Ohhhhhohh,
'til tomorrow is a better day to be,
Ooohhohohoh,
You're better off dead than fucking with me.
Ohooohhoooh
What if there ain't no tomorrow...
Ohooohoho
Well let me tell you, there wasn't one today!

Hey! If you like me to dare,
So that I know why it's gone.
The only one to be.
But it's raining flesh and blood!!!

In the prejudiced mind narrow yourself in,
I'm the servant while you're the king.

Ohooohhoooh
