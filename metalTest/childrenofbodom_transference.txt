Dragged in the light
Like nothing was wrong
Pulled towards where I don't belong
I hear the fallen angles
Sing my requiem

Take a step
Cross the line
Have a thin...
Glance back and you're living in sin
It hurts so bad
Like a war within

Looking at the blade
Aiming at my eyes
Staring to where the evil call my lies
Keep a promise
If you ever will…
Don't say a word just kill, kill, kill

Wrapped in the legs of my demise
You still cry my final goodbyes
While my demons cold laugh
At their last denies

Try to move
Whip it off sell my soul
Jet black
So out of control
Sold out
Shot to hell, pay the price
Feel the toll

Looking at the blade
Aiming at my eyes
Staring to where the evil call my lies
Keep a promise
If you ever will…
Don't say a word just kill, kill, kill

Go!

[Brigde]

(Do you cry) …Yaaahoow Yaah!!

Looking at the blade
Aiming at my eyes
Staring to where the evil call my lies
Keep a promise
If you ever will…
Don't say a word just kill, kill, kill
