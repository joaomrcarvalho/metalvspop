I will forever be reminded
Of how I struggled to survive
The betrayal that you conspired in
All that devotion thrown away
And with everything I confided
I should have known not to trust again
This insanity has divided
Left me with nothing left to destroy
I知 becoming so paranoid
Everyone is so paranoid
In a moment you will see my other side
When I知 confronted
My demeanor turns from Jekyll into Hyde

[Chorus:]
Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will
Feed on the lies
He demands your sacrifice

I can barely control this feeling
Look at the murder in my eyes
I was never good at concealing
Violent thoughts have come to life
Horror will have a deeper meaning
You are the reason this began
Even now I can hear you screaming
There痴 only one thing left to destroy
And I値l no longer be paranoid
No more reason to be annoyed
In a moment you will see my other side
When I知 confronted
My demeanor turns from Jekyll into Hyde

[Chorus]

Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will
Feed on the lies

[Chorus]
