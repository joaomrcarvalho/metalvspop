Fierce is the gale
From the north sea
We drink and rejoice from the chalice
Holding the course
Through long nights and days
The ice and the hail bear no malice
Tow the line
Keep it fine
Every man seeks this end

Valhalla - you are calling
Valhalla - you are calling me home
Valhalla - new day dawning
Valhalla - this is where I belong - I belong

We crash o'er the waves
Bite deep on the oars
Scouring the spray
On the storm's maul
Then lightning reveals
For what we all pray
By Odin in Asgard
It's land fall
Life from death
Combat rests
Heralds peace for the slain

Valhalla - you are calling
Valhalla - you are calling me home
Valhalla - new day dawning
Valhalla - this is where I belong - I belong

The storm in the night takes us there
On an unrelenting tide
As the wind drives us ashore
Halls of Valhalla
Tow the line
Keep it fine
Every man seeks this end

The halls of Valhalla are calling me home
The halls of Valhalla that's where we belong
Valhalla you are calling
Valhalla you are calling me home

Valhalla new day dawning
Valhalla this is where I belong
