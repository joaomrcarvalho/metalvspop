Thrusting from a grave of unholy earth
Giving all his worth
Let the damned be saved
All that evil sin buried underground
Feeling safe and sound in his deadly skin

Heard the cry of pain so he's wide awake
No for heavens sake
He's become insane
How we feared the worst of a world gone mad
Never been so bad with a curse of
His immortal soul at stake
Hear the storm clouds break

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer

Withe a clash of steel as the war begins
All he does is grin
At the pain he feels
Fixing for a war of a hundred years
With with no sense of fear tooth and nail will
Claw at flesh and bone to prevail
His honor will not fail

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer

In this war that you can't win
You will die or live
He has ruled for a thousand years
He can't ever forgive

Fire and brimstone fill the earth and sky
Still he will defy

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer
