My wheels keep spinning backwards
They're spinning round and round and round
My heart can't sometimes take it
Bleeding til it's broken down

Why can't someone fuckin' tell me
What the fuck's going on?
Why don't we love each other?
Constantly beating others down

Now, I find it hard
to live, my own life
Pleasing everyone
While I'm, just dead inside

I wake up I can't breathe
I grip my sheets real tight
What the fuck is happening to me?
Damn right, I can't live this life

Can someone please tell me
What the fuck is going on?
Why don't we love each other?
Constantly beating others down

Now, I find it hard
to live, my own life
Pleasing everyone
While I'm, just dead inside

You wanna take me away
wanna take me away
to die
Life wants to take me away
It's gonna put me away
Tonight

Oh my god can't take this shit
Feeling like a lunatic
Holding your problems 
inside my hand
Holding motherfuckin' shit
feeling like a lunatic
A place for your bullshit to hide [X5]

Can someone please tell me
What the fuck is going on?
Why don't we love each other?
Constantly beating others down

Now, I find it hard
to live, my own life
Pleasing everyone
While I'm, just dead inside
Just dead inside [X3]
I'm just dead inside
