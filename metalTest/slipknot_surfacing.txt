Fuck you all

Running out of ways to run
I can't see, I can't be
Over and over and under my skin
All this attention is doing me in!

Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!

Picking through the parts exposed
Taking shape, taking shag
Over and over and under my skin
All this momentum is doing me in!

Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!

And don't you fucking judge me

Burn!

You got all my love, livin' in your own hate
Drippin' hole man, hard step, no fate
Show you nothing, but I ain't holdin' back
Every damn word I say is a sneak attack
When I get my hands on you
Ain't a fucking thing you can do
Get this 'cause you're never gonna get me
I am the very disease you pretend to be

I am the push that makes you move [x5]

[X2]
Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!

Burn!
