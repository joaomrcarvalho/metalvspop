I make love to mountain lions,
Sleep on red-hot branding irons,
When I walk the roadway shakes,
Bed's a  mess of rattlesnakes,
Voodoo child, black cat bone,
Scratch your back, hear you moan,
I get up, you go down,
Tall building, single bound,
War and peace and love,
Say it if you dare,
Iron fist, velvet glove,
I'm so bad, baby I don't care,
Black-hearted to the bone,
Older than The Rolling Stones,
Been to heaven, been to hell,
Bought the farm, and I won't sell,
Give and take, rise and fall,
Rise up and take it all,
Secret love, I won't tell,
Knock you up and ring your bell,
Kiss the whip, eat the gun,
Tell me it ain't fair,
Midnight victim, hit and run,
I'm so bad, baby I don't care,
I make the blind to see,
Shoot 'em full of R and B,
I make the lame to walk,
Come round and pop your cork,
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am,
Thought I heard the back door slam,
Overkill, walk the line,
Kill the lights, It's lampshade time,
On the road, on the lam,
People running scared,
I'm everything they say
I'm, I'm so bad, baby I don't care.
