It feels good to be here
Ass bet broke and I don't care
Yeah, so good to be clear
I can testify
Listen
I cant fake and attraction to it
Magnetic, it pulls so hard
When two powerful forces collide and break down
Inside and break out at the speed of sound
Locked and loaded I can't hold it
Pick'em up, set'em up, watch it all go down
Oh yeah
Driving in my Cadillac rock box
I am so alive, I learned how to let it go
And on the day that I die I'll have no fear
Listen
I cant fake and attraction to it
Magnetic, it pulls so hard
When two powerful forces collide and break down
Inside and break out at the speed of sound
Locked and loaded I can't hold it

Pick'em up, set'em up, watch it all go down
Oh yeah
Driving in my Cadillac rock box
Stick'em up, get'em up, drop it and throw down
Oh yeah
Hangin' in my Cadillac rock box
Pick'em up, set'em up, watch it all go down
Oh yeah
Driving in my Cadillac rock box
Fill'em up, shoot'em, sit before you fall down
Oh yeah
Bury me in my Cadillac rock box
