Go!

Pain ain't even really what you wanna be
5 feet under seeing what you gonna say
The opportunity too divide
The opportunity of being apart!!

Soon be there, the moon in the sky tonight
We're burning on a purified
Smash your face and then I beat it down
Are we really gonna die

Get up and fight, release your rage, come on and fight
Standing straight faced, it is your fate, calling my name
Calling me pain, and if you stay, you'll bite the scythe
Waiting for you I want to just tell you
If you want peace, prepare for war
Fuck!
