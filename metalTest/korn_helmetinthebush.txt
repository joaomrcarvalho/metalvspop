'Ello, esta Caco
Et eres Caco
Well, you know, you fucking call me the Caco, okay?

I keep asking, what's your lie?
It is disturbing
This isn't mine
Why
Days keep passing
A lot of time
I don't feel right
Please God let me sleep tonight

Everyday confronted circumvents giving in
I just wanna know why!

Want to give it up, but I can't escape. [x4]

I keep asking
Well, again, please try
It is haunting
This takes my mind
Days keep passing
Line after line
I don't feel right
Please God don't let me die tonight,
Die tonight, die tonight, die tonight

Everyday confronted circumvents giving in
I just wanna know why!

Want to give it up, but I can't escape. [x4]

Please God, please God
Please God help me
Please God save me
Please God help me from my painful situation

Please God don't let me slip in tonight, please God
Oh, please God don't let me chip in tonight, please God
Oh, please God don't let me slip in tonight, don't let me die
Please God don't let me give in tonight, don't let me die
