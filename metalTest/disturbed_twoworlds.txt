Give it to me

[Verse 1:]
Two worlds are warring in me
Killing us now
Raging inside
Pleasure has hollowed in me
Remove the sickness
Plaguing my mind

Two worlds are warring in me
Killing us now
Show me the light

[Chorus:]
Two worlds collide
Whenever I step to the front
I look for a new place to hide
While tearing my color away
I swallow my pride
But never forget what I want
Starting to long for a time
I bury the war in my mind

[Verse 2:]
Two worlds are warring in me
Both sides are losing
Patience has died
None of them mourner in me
Drowns my conviction
Regions divide

Two worlds are warring in me
Killing us now
Show me the light

[Chorus:]
Two worlds collide
Whenever I step to the front
I look for a new place to hide
While tearing my color away
I swallow my pride
But never forget what I want
Starting to long for a time
I bury the war in my mind

[Bridge:]
Give me a sign
Tell me when it's time
Show me the light
Tell me when it's fucking over

[Chorus:]
Two worlds collide
Whenever I step to the front
I look for a new place to hide
While tearing my color away
I swallow my pride
But never forget what I want
Starting to long for a time
I bury the war in my mind
