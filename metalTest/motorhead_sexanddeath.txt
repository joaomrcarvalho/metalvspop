Here we are still fighting
fighting for our lives!
Danger in the trenches
but we still survive!

We know who we are!
We know who we are!
We remember every move
(We still bear the scars!)

Don't look for maturity-
don't you even dare!
We are our own security,
and we don't even care!

We know what we do!
We know what we do!
We do what we must
(and we admire our attitude!)

Be damned, if you can't handle it,
(We) hope you break your neck-
Sex and Death!

Show 'em your guitar!
[guitar solo]

Here we are in trouble,
comin' every day
Slaughter in the alley?
(that  would) make our bleedin' day!

We know all the rules!
We know all the rules!
We know more than you would like-
(cuz) we ain't in your school!

We are tired of you now-
we are sick and tired!
We are tired of hearing you
say we should be quiet!

You ain't  worth our time!
You ain't worth our time!
You ain't worth a nickel, babe-
you ain't worth a dime!

We ain't gonna give it up
as long as we got breath:
Sex and Death!!

The answer to life's mystery
is simple and direct:
Sex and Death!

Runnin' down the highway
and we ain't tired yet:
Sex and Death!

Sex and Death!!!
