Watch those idiosyncrasies 
Watch all the idiots fall on me 
Running out of ways to get outta the way 
Take another shot just to stay the same 
But I need some balance - Back it off 
Fill your lungs 'til it makes you cough 
Tell me everything's gonna be alright 
'Cause I don't think I'll make it through tonight 

The only way - Is all the way 

Oh - my - God 
It's judgement day and I'm not prepared 
Everybody out there's running scared 
So - Take a little bit off the top 
I don't care, just make it stop 

I won't give another soul... to you 
I won't give another life... to you 
You have to stop 
Stop! 

Do one thing and say something cryptic 
But the styles always clash 
One thing I know for sure 
The hypothetical won't work anymore 
One wrong move and they will pound! 
My nails are tight inside my wrists 
This sacrament is sacrilege and sentimental 
Deity experimental - Faith is accidental 

I won't give another soul... to you 
I won't give another life... to you 
I won't give another thought... to you 
I won't give anymore of my hope... to you
