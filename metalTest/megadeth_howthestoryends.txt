Far off on the horizon you can barely see their torches
But rest assured they're out there and they're coming
If you listen, the sound is growing nearer of infantry
Marching out a hypnotizing rhythm

Destroying every town, light it up and burn it down
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends

Above the ring of clashing steel, they raise flags of war
A sign to all the warriors who cannot hear
Amidst smoke of cannonballs, they bang the drums of death
Pound a cadence out for those who cannot see

Destroying every town, light it up and burn it down
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends
Poison the wells and scorch the earth, everything slashed and burnt
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends
