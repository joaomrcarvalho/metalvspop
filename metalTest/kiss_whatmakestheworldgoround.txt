Once I was a fool dreamin' my life away, and then yesterday I found you
Lookin' for me, draggin' your heart around at the lost and found

I love you, you're the only one who could make me feel love was smart
I feel you deep inside of me, beatin' up against my heart

And I found out, I found out, what makes the world go 'round
Oh I found out, really found out, what makes the world go 'round

You came up to me, turnin' my head around, I was hangin' on
Until you looked up at me, thrashin' your bedroom eyes, I was paralyzed

I love you, you're the only one who could make me feel love was smart
I feel you deep inside of me, beatin' up against my heart

[Chorus:]
And I found out, oh I found out, what makes the world go 'round
I found out, really found out, what makes the world go 'round and 'round
And I found out, really found out, what makes the world go 'round
I found out, really found out, what makes the world go 'round

Whenever I touch you, you know that I want you
I love you forever, whenever you're ready
