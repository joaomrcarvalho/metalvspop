I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor 
I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the 
Everyday bullshit things that you have done 

Your impossible ego fuck is like a 
Megalomaniacal tab on my tongue 
You fuckin' touch me I will rip you apart 
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that 
Shit you call a heart... 

I don't mind being ogled, ridiculed 
Made to feel miniscule 
If you consider the source, it's kinda pitiful 
The only thing you really know about me is... 
...that's all you'll ever know 

I know why you blame me (yourself) 
I know why you plague me (yourself) 

I'm turning it around like a knife in the shell 
I wanna understand why, but I'm hurting myself
I haven't seen a lotta reasons to stop it 
I can't just drop it 
I'm just a bastard, but at least I admit it 
At least I admit it 

I know why you blame me (yourself) 
I know why you plague me (yourself) 

Kill you - fuck you - i will never be you 
Kill you - fuck you - i will never be you 
I can't fuckin' take it anymore 
A snap of the synapse 
And now it's fuckin' war 
Kill you - fuck you - i will never be you
