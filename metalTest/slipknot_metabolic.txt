Gone - I couldn't murder your promise 
Right before my eyes 
The revolutions of my psychosis 
Kept me outta the way 

Once - inside - all I hold is ash... 

Fail - suppressing every feeling 
I'm in so much pain 
I have every fuckin' right to hate you 
I can't take it! 

The hardest part was knowing that I could never be you 
Now all I do is sit around and wish I could forget you 

My demise - I took a life worth living and 
Made it worth a mockery 
I deny - I fold, but they keep on coming 
(Stop) I'm always ready to die 
But you're killing me 

Who are you to me? Who am I to you? 
Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence? 
By default, you are my only link to the outside
Psychosomatic suicide 
Where were you when I was down? 
Can you show me a way... 
To face everyday with this face - goodbye 

My demise - I took a life worth living and 
Made it worth a mockery 
I deny - I fold, but they keep on coming 
(Stop) I'm always ready to die 
But you're killing me 

When I blur my eyes, they make the whole 
World breath - I see you fucking me 
And I am absolutely controlly every urge
To mutilate - the one and only answer 
So much for memories... 
I wanna derss in your insecurities 
And be the perfect you - I'm through 
I'm out-stretched out for all to loathe 
Here we go - the ultimate irony
