[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

When the power chords come crashing down
Go tearing through my senses
It's for the strong, not for the weak
In light and dark dimensions

It stimulates, regenerates
It's therapeutic healing
It lifts our feet up off the ground
and blasts us through the ceiling

Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings

Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking

Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want
Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want

Ten thousand lights come blazing down
With razor sharp precision
The speakers pour out molten steel
The beat gives double vision

An armour plated raging beast
That's born of steel and leather
It will survive against all odds
Stampeding on forever

Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings

Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking

Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want
Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want
