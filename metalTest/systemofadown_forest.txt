Walk with me my little child 
To the forest of denial 
speak with me my only mind 
walk with me until the time 
and make the forest turn to wine 
you take the legend for a fall 
you saw the product 
why can't you see that you are my child 
why don't you know that you are my mind 
tell everyone in the world, that I'm you 
take this promise to the end of you 
walk with me my little friend 
Take this promise to the end 
Speak with me my only mind 
Walk with me until the end 
And make the forest turn to sand 
you take the legend for a fall 
you saw the product 
why can't you see that you are my child 
why don't you know that you are my mind 
tell everyone in the world, that I'm you 
take this promise to the end of you 
Take this promise for a ride 
you saw the forest, now come inside 
You took the legend for it's fall 
you saw the product of it all 
no televisions in the air 
no circumcisions on the chair 
You made the weapons for us all 
just look at us now 
why can't you see that you are my child 
why don't you know that you are my mind 
tell everyone in the world, that I'm you 
take this promise to the end of you
