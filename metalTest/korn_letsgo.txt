Let's Go!

What's the problem
Why can't you relax?
Inside hating on everything, that makes me mad
Love is scary and love is to blame
Guess I'll lose you and that is a shame
because I'm ovah you
Ovah you
Ovah you
Ovah you
Ovah you
Ovah you
Ovah you

Let's Go!

I'm taking over
I won't be lead astray
Life's doesn't last long
I gotta get away

The solution I try to reveal
But the question is how can you really be healed?
Hate is scary and hate is to blame
God, I need you and that is a shame
Because I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you

Let's Go!

I'm taking over
I won't be lead astray
Life's doesn't last long
I gotta get away

Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away

LETS GO!

I'm taking over
I won't be lead astray
Life's doesn't last long
I gotta get away
