Whoa yeah!

[Verse]
Ready, set, go, light the fire below
No time left to rest my head
Time for action, gonna start the show
I'll do my sleeping when I'm dead
Catch your breath because I won't slow down
I'm gonna kick it up instead

'Cause I know what I'm doing
And I know what I want

[Chorus]
Gimme life, for the takin'
Gimme love, 'til I'm shakin'
Gimme rules, just for breakin'
Because it's never enough, never enough, never enough!

[Verse]
People waste time on their hopes and dreams
Fate is always in my hands
Only way I know is the way I'm gonna go
When others sit and make their plans
I don't stop 'til I make it to the top
Don't need no one to understand

'Cause I know what I'm doing
And I know what I want

[Chorus]

You can see what what you want to believe
I'm gonna live the life I live
Gonna try until the day I die
'Cause I'm giving all I've got to give

[Guitar Solo]

Gimme life, for the takin'
Gimme love, 'til I'm shakin'
Gimme rules, just for breakin'
Because it's never enough, never enough...
Gimme life, for the takin'
Gimme love, 'til I'm shakin'
Gimme rules, just for breakin'
Because it's never enough, never enough
No it's, never enough, never enough
Give it to me, never enough, never enough...
Never enough!
