Our lives are fake
They mean nothing, you see
Our dreams are lost
Just a fantasy
How many times have you been misguided?
How many times have your hopes been smited?
This life means nothing to me

Victimized, deceived
A black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease
The black veil of insanity misleads

Our hearts are free
Does that mean anything?
Do what we’re told
Self-seeking hypocrisy
How many times have you been misguided?
How many times have your hopes been smited?
This life means fuck to me

Victimized, deceived
A black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease
The black veil of insanity misleads

Black veil, it’s coming for me
It’s coming for me, it’s coming for me
It’s coming for me, it’s the black veil
Of insanity, it’s coming for me
Set free, set free, set free, set free
Set free, set free, set free, set free
Set free

Victimized, deceived
A black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease
The black veil of insanity misleads
