In the back of my mind I can
Barely even remember when
There was nothing left to hide and
She had found her way inside then
I was forced to walk alone
Living in an empty home
All I wanted was to hide and
Try to numb the ache inside
And I’m still afraid of the lights
And a thousand voices share their
Laughter at my demise

Now if I am to survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast
That’s been eating me alive
The infection must die

Nothing left but a broken man
Terrified of everything
Nothing left of his foolish pride, his
Fond memories slowly die, then
As he wakes again alone
Still a prisoner in his home
Ready to allow the dark to
Penetrate his broken heart
And he’s still afraid of the light
And a thousand voices share their
Laughter at his demise

Now if I am to survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast
That’s been eating me alive
The infection must die

Come on, motherfucker

Now if I am to survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast
That’s been eating me alive
The infection must die
This is where I draw the line
This infection must die
Give me release from this demon of mine
The infection must die
The infection must die
