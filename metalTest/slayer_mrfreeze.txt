[Kyle Toucher]

Will you be the lucky one,
who will see the deadly one?
You will die on your knees,
by the hand of Mr. Freeze.

Will you see when the rest are blind?
Will you remain frozen in time?

Will you flee underground?
Watch the blanket search the ground.
You will die on your knees,
by the hand of Mr. Freeze.

Horror awaits for those who evade.
Ice cold blood, stops in their veins.

Arm yourselves to the "T".
Repel the threat of Mr. Freeze.
See the blood drop in your eyes.
See your family burned alive.

I don't even know you.
I just know where you live.
I've raided your child's bedroom.
Burned his virgin skin.
I'd crucify your nation.
I'll leave your dead to rot.
I'll praise your damaged street.
And bear an iron cross.

The oceans have been ripped away.
It does no good to pray.
All todays cataclysm.
Men restore to cannibalism.

I'm worth all you'd care for,
Then I'll fuck you in the ass.
Oh so fucking happy,
As I kick your face and laugh.
Todays war stories,
At night I can hear you scream.
There's blood on your pillow.
This is no bad dream.
You try to think of reason,
And all you can do is scream!
