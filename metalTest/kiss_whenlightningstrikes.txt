Alright!

[Verse]
It's my move, the ground's shakin'
This time I'm gonna knock you down
I'm coming through, no more waiting
I'm on the move at the speed of sound
I'm alive like a hurricane flies
I'm gonna run, I don't walk the line
When the sky and the worlds collide
It's my time, I'm gonna take what's mine
Live wire, a loaded gun
Get ready 'cause I'm the one

[Chorus]
When lightning strikes
I howl at the rain and thunder
A fiery light
A flash of light electrifies my heart and my soul
And lightning's gonna strike tonight

[Verse]
Hold on, if your coming
Let go, if you're staying behind
I feel the need, the sky is humming
I take the lead and it's my turn to shine
I'm alive, got the power inside
Gonna rock, they call me dynamite
High voltage, running free
Release the storm that's inside of me
Black cloud, I'm the rebel son
Get ready 'cause I'm the one

[Chorus]
When lightning strikes
I howl at the rain and thunder
A fiery light
A flash of light...

[Guitar Solo]

When lightning strikes
I howl at the rain and thunder
A fiery light
When lightning strikes

When lightning strikes (when the lightning strikes)
When lightning strikes (when the lightning strikes)
A fiery light (when the lightning strikes)
When lightning strikes, electrifies my heart and my soul
