He can feel them turn
Spools of milky thread
Folding into though
Seconds tick apart

You molded it, you made it, you caused it, reaction
You licked it, you stole from it, you lied to it, now watch it die
You beat it, you ate from it, you spit on it, retraction
You ignored it, didn’t explain to it, you starved it, now watch it die

(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANYMORE
(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANY…

Resolved to find a way,
To curb his skin addiction
To calcify his mind, 
To find the ones who made him
MADE HIM THIS WAY

Greasy winged, uh cus-diaper beaking caw fuss, 
I hear your dung falling, I hear your dung falling down
Affing, I mean laughing,
I mean affing at me, eyeing my dowNature
Fat jaws, winter winter present present sniff
Sniff for the fifth time, is no time
Do I come, do I go, do they really seem to know
Gotsta get me some of that creamy filling

(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANYMORE
(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANY-

My assembly line of faces are waiting in a row
Stiff, cold, blue complexions that I used to know
Burn abide my yearbook, for there I found no friends
But the ones I knew were shrink-wrapped in the end

(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANYMORE
(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANY…

CAN’T TAKE ANY…

Their feathers are my hair

CAN’T TAKE ANYMORE
CAN’T TAKE ANY-
