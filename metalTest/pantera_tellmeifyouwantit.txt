[Interpretation I]

I know you need me,
You know, your the one you've been looking for

Sometimes, it don_t seem right
Your not alone, you need someone
to try, you have to make it by

Oh, tell me if you want it
(Tell me if you want it)
Oh, tell me if you want it
(Tell me if you want it

Your the one, in my dreams
Were making love
Laid back in my cool breeze

Sometimes you feel so wild
I'm on the look
You need someone to try
You gotta make it by

Oh, tell me if you want it
(Tell me if you want it)
Oh, tell me if you want it
(Tell me if you want it)
