Hey, fellows, have you heard the news?
The girls on the town are being misused.
I seen it all in a dream last night.
Girls leaving this town 'cause you don't treat'em right.

I'm leaving, leaving here,
I'm leaving, leaving here,
Hey, you fellows, better change your ways
Or they'll be leaving this town in a matter of days.
The girls say, and it rings so true,
We fellows run around with someone new.
I'm leaving, leaving here,
I'm leaving, leaving here,
Yeah, one by one
Yeah, two by two
Yeah, three by three
Yeah, four by four.

Loving woman is a wonderful thing
But the way that we treat'em is a crying shame.
One day, one day, and it won't belong.
And all them fine chicks be gone.

I'm leaving, leaving here,
I'm leaving, leaving here,
Hey, you fellows, better change your ways
Or they'll be leaving this town in a matter of days.
The girls say, and it rings so true,
We fellows run around with someone new.
I'm leaving, leaving here,
I'm leaving, leaving here,
Yeah, one by one
Yeah, two by two
Yeah, three by three
Yeah, four by four,
Oh yeah, Oh, yeah hah,
I'm leaving here.
