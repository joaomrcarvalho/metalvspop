The night wind blows
Your heart rate grows
Your pulse is racing faster

They're on your trail
They know you'll fail
You're flirting with disaster

Creatures

The frost lies thick
Your breath comes quick
No chance for your survival

Life takes it's toll
And burns your soul
They've never had a rival

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night

Their sense of smell
Was honed in hell
Their eyes sharp as needles

You're bathed in sweat
You've lost your bet
Caught in this upheaval

Creatures

You're on your own
So scream and moan
It's pointless now for praying

They'll run you through
You'll get what's due
Then they'll call it a day

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night

Creatures

The night wind blows
Your heart rate grows

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night

Creatures of the night

Creatures
