(Yes) Bad blood, (yes) black night, (My God, yes) all the world,
(Yes) Red mouth (yes) insane (yes, My God) Order,
(See) Firestorm (see) black death, (do you see) burning there,
(Yes) Red smile (yes) white noise, fade to black, nobody cares.

Wake up now, try to run, howling pain, burning sun, creep
and crawl, hiding place, out of breath, turn your face,
Evil grins, at the sight, tendon snap, red tonight,
Black inside, cancer grown, in your skin, in your bone,

(Now) White face, (now) red hands (iron stake) everywhere,
(Now) Chrome spikes (now) insane, (burning me) order,
(Now) Sleeping (now) teeth grin, (audience) all eyes stare,
(Now) Waliking (now) dying, fade to black, nobody cares.

Push the door locked and barred, gone away, gone to far,
Finger crawl, after you, freezing touch, stick like glue,
Could embrace, stranglehold, lost the race, oh so cold,
Red in here, bright knife hack, white noise, fade to black.

(Yes) Red pain, (yes) red blood, (sinking down) black despair,
(So) White bone, (yes) insane, (do youe see) order,
(All) Screaming, (now) silent (God is love) say your prayers
