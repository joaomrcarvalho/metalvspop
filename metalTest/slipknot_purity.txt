Maze...psychopathic daze...I create this waste 
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic 
ways...can't escape this place...I deny your face 
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying 

Put me in a homemade cellar 
Put me in a hole for shelter 
Someone hear me please, all I see is hate 
I can hardly breathe, and I can hardly take it

Lost...ran at my own cost...hearing laughter, scoffed 
Learning from the rush, detached from such and such 
Bleak...all around me, weak...listening, incomplete 
I am not a dog, but I'm the one your dogging 

I am in a buried kennel 
I have never felt so final 
Someone find me please, losing all reserve 
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying 

You all stare, but you'll never see 
There is something inside me 
There is something in you I despise 

Cut me - show me - enter - I am 
willing and able and never any danger to myself 
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain 
Or was my tolerance a phase? 
Empathy, out of my way 
I can't die
