I'm drowning and sedated
Patiently Awaiting 
For my mind to really come down
I'm afraid of being hated
Cuz I'm so Jaded
Not like everybody somehow

Trapped underneath the stairs
Dealing with the fears
Constantly it's silent and loud

I am who I am
There's nothing I can do
I try to hide it
and it keeps breaking through
I feel the world so different 
than any one of you
Remember who you are
There's nothing you can do

I'm constantly debating
Why I'm always playing
Walking around with my head down
I don't want to be like anyone
What the fuck could I have done?
To deserve this terror somehow

Trapped underneath the stairs
Dealing with the fears
Constantly it's silent and loud

I am who I am
There's nothing I can do
I try to hide it
and it keeps breaking through
I feel the world so different 
than any one of you
Remember who you are
There's nothing I can do

I'm not like 'em
Can't hide what I am
Like it or not
I push it down
it comes back again
The Medicine stopped working long ago
I am my problem
Inside has nowhere to go [X5]
Nowhere to fuckin' go!

I am who I am
There's nothing I can do
I try to hide it
and it keeps breaking through
I feel the world so different 
than any one of you
Remember who you are
There's nothing I can do

You're always stuck with you [X2]
