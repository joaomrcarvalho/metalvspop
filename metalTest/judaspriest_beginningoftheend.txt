The time has come
And as I reach up to the sky
The love will never die

At last it's here
The darkest sky begins to clear
The final hour draws near

But the voices are calling me
Erasing the pain and the fear

So lay me down
Lay me to rest
It's over now 'cause I know
It's the beginning of the end

And so we'll rise
By the grace of God alone
His words are carved in stone

I'm never gone
I'll always be within your heart
Waiting's the worst part

Now the voices are calling me
Soothing me and easing the pain and the fear

So lay me down
Lay me to rest
It's over now 'cause I know
It's the beginning of the end

And I see my life pass quickly by
I am watching
All these years we thought we were so wise
They mean nothing

Walk alone into the dying mist come alive for ever
See the things we've never seen before
Hand in hand together

They galling rays are lighting up the open door
We've all been waiting for
All the voices are calling me
Showing the path that is clear

So lay me down
Lay me to rest
It's over now 'cause I know
It's the beginning of the end

So lay me down
Lay me to rest
It's over now 'cause I know
It's the beginning of the end
