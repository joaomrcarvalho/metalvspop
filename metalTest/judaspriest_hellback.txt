I have roamed so far away
I have found there's no turning back
I have seen so many things
I have been to hell and back

Still in the land of the living
Rocking the home of the brave
Staying alive and still kicking
Ain't got no need to be saved

Out of the fire and into the black
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back

When I was young life was savage
The leather gets scuffed as it's worn
Rolling along you get damaged
So you grab the bull by the horns

Out of the fire and into the black
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back
Taking it up higher when you're under attack

We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back

We have roamed so far away
We have found there's no turning back
We have seen so many things
We have been to hell and back

Out of the fire and into the black
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back
Taking it up higher when you're under attack

We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back

We've all been under attack
We've all been to hell and back
