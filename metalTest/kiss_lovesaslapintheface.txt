I been up, down, and all around, tell you what I'm feelin'
I been hurt and I've found, been pushed around, it's how I got this feelin'

I never thought I could hurt so good, no no
I never thought I could lose myself, but I just can't hide it
They never let you down easy, now listen

[Chorus:]
Sometimes love is like a slap in the face, you been burned and still
It's the same old mistake
If you want my opinion, I'll give it to you straight
Love is like a slap in the face
Singin' na na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na na

Love's got a hold on me, I can't believe it, but it's plain to see
Turns me upside down and inside out
Don't know why it never fails to make you scream and shout

I never knew I could fool myself, no no, I never thought I could hurt so good
But I just can't hide it, guess I'm feelin' no pain, now listen

[chorus]

I never knew I could hurt so good, no no, I never thought I'd say nonono, no no
But I'm here babe, I got a secret inside

Sometimes love is like a ball and chain
Keeps you up at night, why is it always the same
If you wanna know the truth, it's something I can't explain
Yeah love is like a ball and chain

Yeah na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na, na na na na na [repeats out]
