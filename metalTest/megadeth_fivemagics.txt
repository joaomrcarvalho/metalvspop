Bestow upon me Knowledge
Wizard, all knowing, all wise

[Solo: Friedman]

I want to rule this kingdom
Make sweet the breeze now defiled

[Solo: Friedman]

Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists
In velvet gloves of sin

[Solo: Friedman]

Parade the grey robed monks
The vestal virgins, wheel the wyvern's in

[Solo: Friedman]

[Solo: Friedman]

Let the ceremony consecrate marriage
Let me be the protege of Five Magics

Give me alchemy, give me wizardry,
Give me sorcery, thermatology
Electricity, Magic if you please,
Master all of these, Bring him to his knees

I master five magics, I master five magics
I master five magics, I master five magics

Possessed with hellish torment, possessed with hellish torment
I master magics five, I master magics five
Hunting the abyss lord, hunting the abyss lord
Only one will stay alive, only one will stay alive
He who lives by the sword, he who lives by the sword
Will surely also die, will surely also die
He who lives in sin, he who lives in sin
Will surely live the lie
