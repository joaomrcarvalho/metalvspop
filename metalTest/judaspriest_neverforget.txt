As the sun sets on another day
All the memories will never fade away
Looking back to all those moments that we shared
Where it all began with all those dreams we dared
We leave with no regrets - we will never forget

We'll play on till the end
It's not over not over my friends
We are together tonight
Reunited for all of our lives
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget

When the dark skies came along to test our steel
We came together and showed the world just how we feel
So remember this
We can never fall
In our hearts we're all for one and one for all
So now we will rejoice
Tonight with one voice

We'll play on till the end
It's not over my friends
We are together tonight
Reunited for all of our lives
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget

In our hearts and in our minds
We know we can't leave this behind
In our hearts and in our soul
You know we'll never be alone

As we relive the best times of our lives
You were there for us and stood right by our sides
Yes we know that all good things come to an end
This is just farewell and not goodbye my friends
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget

We'll play on till the end
It's not over my friends
We are together tonight
Reunited for all of our lives
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget
