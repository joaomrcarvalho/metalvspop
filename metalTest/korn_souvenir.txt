I never knew what I was gonna be
Somebody saw what I couldn't see
And lifted me up now
I never thought I could be worthy of
Loving under the sky above
Don't let the wonderful
Why does everybody have to fit in
You should feel comfortable in the skin
Does that mean I am the

[Pre-chorus:]
Souvenir of sadness
Method to the madness
Hands up if you feel this
Anyone who has this...

[Chorus:]
Stand up! Nobody's dyin' to save you
Speak up! Nobody's waiting to see you
Wake up! Nobody's working to pay you
Let me make it clear you have this
Back then, nobody knew in the school yard
Now then! You have grown up to be this hard
Go then! Walk on this world with your heart scarred
You're the souvenir of sadness

They never knew what I was gonna say
Punch me and kick me and run away
You know who you are so
Now look at me what do you have to say
Never give up for you anyway
You know who you are so
Now look at me what do you have to say
Never give up for you anyway
Happy childhood back-lash
