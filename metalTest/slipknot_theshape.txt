Too tragic to stay with you 
Too static to try for you 
These scars, they swallow hard
The part of the past that's hollow and dark 
Too horrid to kill for you 
Too sordid to die with you 
Unstable as always, come down 
Everything else is just dust and sound 

SEPARATE (I've lost my only way) 
SEPARATE (I've lost my only way) 
SEPARATE (I've lost my only way) 
SEE THE SHAPE (Broken and thrown away) 

I'd give it all away, come take it all away 
You can't resent the fear 
Somebody tell me how I got here 
I'd give it all to you, come take it, it's all for you 
The noise is so damn loud, but 
Everything else is just dust and sound 

I don't wanna do this anymore 
Everything's shit - everything's been taken 
Forsaken - gotta start it over cuz I'm hearing it 
Backwards - DON'T make sense - DON'T feel better 
Who's better? It's not that simple 
You gotta figure it out before you make things difficult 
It's not a word, it's a problem, the problem was easy 
Draw your conclusions - solutions? 
Anybody else wanna run? 
Contorting, distorting - I am undone 
One less propaganda nightmare fixture 
Are you getting the picture?
