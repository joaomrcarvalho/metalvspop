Some ladies love me
Some ladies don't
But I know what your gonna do
Even when you say you won't
I know you want me
You've got desire
Out of the frying pan
Into the fire
Drawn to the flame
Your hands are tied
You wanna take me baby
All up inside

You feel the hunger
But it's much too much
You can look baby
But you just can't touch

This is Russian Roulette
One pull of the trigger is all you're gonna get
My deck is loaded when I like what I see
You're gonna lose it all eventually

Got me where you want me
Go on and take a bite
Open up and let your backbone stiff
Such a pretty sight
You try to talk
But you just can't speak
Your pulse is strong
But your knees are weak

You feel the hunger
But it's much too much
You can look baby
But you just can't touch

This is Russian Roulette
One pull of the trigger is all you're gonna get
My deck is loaded when I like what I see
You're gonna lose it all eventually
