[Verse]
Heaven, don't send me someone to love
Angels know, they're not what I'm dreaming of
Tell me about your fantasies
You know what I need tonight
Baby, you and me, we're like TNT
Light the dynamite

[Chorus]
Too parts trouble (too parts trouble)
Double down tough... (double down tough)
Danger you
Danger me
Danger us

[Verse]
I know, people don't always know what they need
Passion play can make a lonely heart bleed
I don't want my candy sweet
You don't want your lovin' nice
Everytime we meet, we're like TNT
Light the dynamite

[Chorus]

Too parts trouble (too parts trouble)
Ready, steady, rough (ready, steady, rough)
Danger you
Danger me
Danger us

Well, alright!
Danger us!
Ooh, yeah-yeah!

Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

Tell me about your fantasies
You know what I need tonight
Baby, you and me, we're like TNT
Light the dynamite

[Chorus]

Too parts trouble (too parts trouble)
Ready, steady, rough (ready, steady, rough)
Danger you
Danger me
Danger us

Wow!

Oh yeah...
