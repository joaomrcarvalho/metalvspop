Passion fire runnin' through my veins
Get a little bit of love and I go insane
I may talk big, baby, I don't lie
Ooh the guys don't know but the girls know why
Ooh girls know why, whoo oh
Get down and get to it
I know you can do it
Get down and get to it
I know you can do it, oh, oh, oh, oh

Radar for love, radar for love
I've got radar for love
Radar for love, ooh yeah

When you feel so hot that you can't hold still
And you don't know how you're gonna get your fill
Send an S.O.S. baby, I'm your man
If I don't make good baby no one can
Oh no one can, whoo oh
Get down and get to it
I know you can do it, come on
Get down and get to it
