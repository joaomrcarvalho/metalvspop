I, I am clearly broken and no one knows what to do
Pieces of the puzzle don't fit, so, I pound them into you
Itching is the pulse inside
Creeping out to come alive
It's just doing what it's gonna do

Times are looking grim these days
Holding on to everything
It's hard to draw the line

Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!

I can't wait to rip my eyes out and look at you
Peace through pain is precious especially when it's done by you
Itching is the pulse inside
Creeping out to come alive
It's just doing what it's gonna do

Times are looking grim these days
Holding on to everything
It's hard to draw the line
And I'm, I'm hiding in this empty space
Tortured by my memories of what I've left behind

Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!

Times are looking grim these days
Holding on to everything
It's hard to draw the line
And I'm, I'm hiding in this empty space
Tortured by my memories of what I've left behind

Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
