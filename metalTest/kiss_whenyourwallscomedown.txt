Liar, liar, got your pants on fire
I know you want it, you know you want it too
Hey diddle diddle, when the cat wants to fiddle
The kitten's gotta give him the moon

And they say "you gotta look before you leap"
And "we're gonna judge you by the friends you keep"
But you're looking nasty and I'm in too deep
You'll be real happy to be losing sleep

[Chorus:]
When your walls come down, when your walls come down
When your walls come down,
you get so crazy when there's no one around

You got your script from a Cosmo guide,
"15 Ways to Find a Lover"
Don't you make me chase you, cause the author lied
You'll get your answers, babe, under the covers

You say "I wanna wait until I'm really sure"
And "I want a love to last forever more"
And "I've got my pride, I've got my dignity"
Well you'll swallow everything when you're with me

[chorus]
When your walls come down, when your walls come down
When your walls come down, ah, you're so
(Come here baby and - auw...)

And they say "you gotta look before you leap"
And "we're gonna judge you by the friends you keep"
Listen, you're looking nasty and I'm in too deep
You'll be real happy to be losing sleep

[chorus repeats out]
