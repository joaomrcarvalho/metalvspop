[Music/Lyrics-Alexi "Wildchild" Laiho]

[spoken:]
From now on, we are enemies
You and I

I'm an outcast on the path of rebound
Everything is frail, I desolate, crush, and burn
I have chosen darkness to be my guide
While war is in my heart, death is by my side

[chorus]
Warheart! With no remains of compassion or love
Warheart! Hate your fellow as yourself

I have chosen night to be my guide
When the daylight strikes, I hide in my trench and die

[chorus]
Warheart! With no remains of compassion or love
Warheart! Hate your fellow as yourself

I'm the warheart, I'm dying to win the battle I live everyday
One for all and all for me, I'm an animal, better set me free

I'm an outcast on the path of rebound
Everything is frail, I desolate, crush, and burn
I have chosen darkness to be my guide
While war is in my heart, death is by my side

[chorus]
Warheart! With no remains of compassion or love
Warheart! Hate your fellow as yourself

I'm the warheart, I'm dying to win the battle I live everyday
One for all and all for me, I'm an animal, better set me...

I'm the warheart, I'm dying to win the battle I live everyday
One for all and all for me, I'm an animal, better set me free
