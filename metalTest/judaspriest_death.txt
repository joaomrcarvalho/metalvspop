I will take your final breath
And I will be your last regret
Cold blood - runs in my blackened heart
Tearing - every soul apart

Messenger of death - wields the scythe
Of man's damnation
Messenger of death - hold his blade
For termination

Sin - is what I feast upon
I'm forging my crematorium
Your tomb - is waiting here for you
Welcome to my ritual

Messenger of death - wirlds the scythe
Of man's damnation
Messenger of death - holds his blade
For termination

Death rides out from the storm
We turn to God and cry
Ignored we turn to face
This vengeance from the sky

Death rides out from the storm
No time left to repent
No quarter - no escape
No line of self defence

Death rides out from the storm
In terror we confess
Our voice is heard no more
His deed is merciless

Death rides out from the storm
Deface humanity
There's no escape from this
Human calamity

Death rides out from the storm
We turn to God and cry
Ignored we turn to face
This vengeance from the sky
Messenger of death - wields the scythe
Of man's damnation
Messenger of death - holds his blade
For termination
