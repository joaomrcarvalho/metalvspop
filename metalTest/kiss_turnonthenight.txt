Everyone's thinkin' they're so hot tonite,
but there's a fire in your eyes
Everybody wants you girl,
but I want you more than any other guy
You got what I want, I got what you need, fire below
So if you know it, show it, don't let me go, whooah
Turn on the night - I can't wait, can't wait any longer
Turn on the night - yeah,
I wanna feel this feeling get stronger

Take me in your arms, I'll take you into my heart
Let's bring this love to life

C'mon baby put your finger on the switch,
let's make some sparks ignite
Show me what you want, show me what you need, fire below
C'mon and take me, shake me, don't let me go, whooah

[Chorus:]
Turn on the night - I can't wait, can't wait any longer
Turn on the night - yeah,
I wanna feel this feeling get stronger
Turn on the night - I can't wait, can't wait any longer
Turn on the night - yeah,
you know this feeling keeps getting stronger

Hey babe - you got what I want,
I got what you need, fire below
So if you know it, show it, don't let me go, whooah

[chorus]
