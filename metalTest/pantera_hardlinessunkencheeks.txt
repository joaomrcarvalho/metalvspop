As a child I was given the gift to entertain you.
But through blood I inherited a life that could destroy you.

I drink all day. I smoke all day.
I took Madonna's breath away
I've done it all but tap the vein.
These hard lines and sunken cheeks are text book reasons
All these Christians come alive and try to sell you

My soul for a goat, yet I'll outlive the old.

You know it's bad, some may say sad,
a hangover is inspiration.
Like a junkie I hurt for it.
A bad trip, the emptiness.

I never sleep, or always sleep
a lack of fulfillment to me is me.
The big picture.
These hard lines and sunken cheeks
are part of what the Christians mean
to immortalize my situation.

My soul for a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old.

Embrace some religion.
To get close to some undivine ejaculation point.
Simply to thy ghost I cling.
Simply to thy ghost I reject.
Simply to thy ghost I give spit.

Tempter, tempting, tempt me. Molest me.
You know that I'll submit.
For this is my weakness
and it saves me from relationships
With those Christians you know they'll sell you

my soul for a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old.
