The convoy lights are dead ahead
The Merchantmen lay in their bed,
The trump of... diesels hammers down,
In the oily sea - the killing ground,
His knuckles white his eyes alight,
He slams the hatch on the deadly night,
A cunning fox in the chickens lair
A hound of hell and the devil don't care

[Chorus]
Running silent, Running deep, we are your final prayer,
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,
A silent death lies waiting, for all of you below,
Running silent, Running deep, sink into your final sleep

Chill the hearts of fighting men,
In open ocean wondering when?
The lethal silver fish will fly
The boat will shiver - men will die
A cast of millions - a part of play
Killer? Victim? or fool for a day
Obeying an order - men have to die
Us or them - a well rehearsed lie

[Chorus]

The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn,
The tar black smell of burning oil,
On the way down to Davy Jones,
Every man for himself - you're on your own
The wolf eyes watch the crosswire
"Stern tubes ready", "Aim and fire!"
They can pin some medal on your chest,
But in two more weeks - dead like the rest

[Chorus]
