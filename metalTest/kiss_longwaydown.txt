Gypsy, has eyes that hide the secrets no one sees
Easy, you smile until she brings you to your knees
Stick around 'til you get the truth
Taste blood when you get your proof (oh yeah)
Find that you've never understood
Give it all, but it's meant for good (oh yeah)

And I know this life makes fools of wise men, thieves, and kings (yeah)
When we lose we live our lives like puppets on a string
Close your eyes and you'll lose your soul
Do your time, but there's no parole from here
No chance when the end is near
Hear the words that you never thought you'd hear (yeah)
Life whispers in your ear

It's a long way down
When ground starts comin'
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen
It's a long way when you fall from the top

Yeah!

Build it all on a bed of lies
Standing tall 'til you realize you're here
Look away, but you can't pretend
Gonna pray for a way when the end is near
Life whispers in your ear

It's a long way down
When ground starts comin'
I tried to tell you
But you would not listen
It's a long way
Such a long, long way
It's a long way down
When the ground starts comin'
I tried to tell you
But you would not listen
It's a long way
Such a long, long way
A long way down
A long way down
When you fall from the top
