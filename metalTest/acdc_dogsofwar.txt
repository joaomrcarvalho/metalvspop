Dogs of war
Dogs of war
Dogs of war
Dogs of war
Dogs of war

You've been a pattern man
Let go, I guess you can
Don't need to feel your touch
Right underneath the lights
Taking all you can
Rich game it ain't in plans
Feel the booths up on the ground
Talk and blew it all around
Stanch and the bullets
Shooting the whistles, soldiers of fortune
Searching premade, face the game, marching everything

We'll be the dogs of war
We'll be the dogs of war, dogs of war
Send me with dogs of war
I'll find, find in the night, granary or grinding fight
Keep it tight and keep it laugh when the smile

Stanch and the bullets
Shutting the whistles, soldiers are a fortune
Searching premade, face the game, marching everything
We'll be the dogs of war
We'll be the dogs of war, dogs of war
Send me with dogs of war

We'll be the dogs of war
We'll be the dogs of war, dogs of war
We'll be the dogs of war
We'll be the dogs of war, dogs of war, dogs of war
We'll be the dogs of war
We'll be the dogs of war
We'll be the dogs of war
Yeah we'll be the dogs of war
