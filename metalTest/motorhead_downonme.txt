Sometimes there's nothing to say,
In the hard times,
Do you know me,
or are we all lost in the game,
You can be a thousand to one,
or you can die alone,
There's no disgrace,
when no one knows your name,

Sometimes it hurts your heart,
when you lose control,
Do you see me,
can I depend on you,
You can be a soldier of love,
or you can lose your soul,
There's no time,
to make sure it's all true,

Give your blood and save me,
Give your love and amaze me,
I see you now,
I know you see,
Give a sucker an even break,
Another emotion to fake,
Down On Me,
Down On Me,

Sometimes it makes you laugh,
in the darkness,
Do you feel it,
don't tell me no lies,
You can be a God or a Fool,
it's your decision,
Are you forbidden,
you can fight or die,

Give your blood and save me,
Give your love and amaze me,
See it through,
What can you be,
Give a sucker an even break,
Another emotion to fake,
Down On Me,
Down On Me,

Give your blood and save me,
Give your love and amaze me,
I see you now,
And I know you see,
Give a sucker an even break,
Another emotion to fake,
Down On Me,
Down On Me,

Give your hands to hold me,
Give your arms to enfold me,
Say the word,
Set me free,
Bring me in out from the storm,
Keep me safe from scorn,
Down On Me,
Down On Me
