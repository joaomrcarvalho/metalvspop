I'm in conniptions for the final act
You came here for
The one derivative you manage
Is the one I abhor

I need a minute to eliminate
For everyone the
Everyday abusive things
That you have done

Your impossible ego
Fuck is like a
Megalomaniacal tab
On my tongue

And if you touch me, I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take
A bite out of that bitch
You call a heart

I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

I'm turning it around
Like a knife in the shell
I wanna understand why
But I'm hurting myself

I haven't seen a lot of reasons
To stop it, I can't just drop it
I'm just a bastard but at least I admit it
At least I admit it

I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

I know you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

I know why you plague yourself
I know why you plague yourself
