Stand or fall, live or die (Stand)
Strong and true to the end (Now)
Fly the flag, let them see (Sky)
We will never bend the knee (Don't fail)
We are the last of all (Here)
If we give way we lose (No)
So can you stand with me? (We can)
Will you now pay your dues (Hai)

The tales they tell, of how we stand this day
We that defend our cause
Will last a thousand years
Come now the dogs of war

Break or hold, die or kill (Live)
Try or fail, or succeed (Fight)
We must be an iron wall (Hold)
When the heart receives the call (We go)
We are the least of them (Fight)
We are few, but we are brave (Yes)
So can you stand with me (We Will)

The tales they tell, of how we stood this day
We few that know the law
Will last a thousand years
Hear now the dogs of war

Sun is set, darkness falls (See)
Now comes the enemy (Beware)
Draw sword and shield defy (Hai)
All their wives must scream and cry (Stand fast)
We are the last hope now (Last)
Of all our people fair, so will you die with me (We do)
Will you now do your share (Hai)

The tales they tell, of what we do this day
We that guard the door
WIll last a thousand years
Let go the dogs of war
