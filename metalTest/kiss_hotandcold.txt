Oh yeah!

Look out!

Oh yeah!

[Verse]
Hey, what's your name?
Yeah, we're both thinking the same thing
Well, now let the games begin
Let me introduce you to pleasure
I will seduce you my treasure
You know you'll ask me for more and more
But honey, don't you know just what you've got in store

[Chorus]
Well, if it's too hot, you're too cold
If it's too loud, you're too old
Baby, let go of what you can't hold
Baby, you're too hot and cold

[Verse]
What color is my heart
Can it be torn apart?
Don't turn your back on me
'Cause baby can't you guess by now
You're gonna be in misery

[Chorus]

Baby, you're cold!

Ow!

Dig this!

[Guitar Solo]

Yeah-yeah!

I've got the power any hour
Baby feel my tower of power!

Well, if it's too hot, you're too cold
If it's too loud, you're too old
Baby, let go of what you can't hold
If it's too hot you're cold
Too hot (too hot)
Baby it's uh, too cold (too cold)
Make up your mind (too hot) yeah!
Too hot, too cold
H-hot, look out!
Too hot (too hot)
Too hot baby (too cold)
You're much too cold
Make up your mind (too hot)
Too hot, too cold
H-hot, h-hot, yeah!
Too hot (too hot)
Too hot (too cold)
Make up your mind (too hot)
Too hot (too hot)
Too hot (too cold)
