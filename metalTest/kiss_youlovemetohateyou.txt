You tell lies when you look at me, smile when you look away
Spin a web any fool can see, put your candy on display

It's a game of who needs who, who's on top, me or you
Pleasure and pain feel the same when the night is thru

[Chorus:]
Girl you want me to cry, feel like I'm gonna die
Girl you want me to bleed, feel the thrill of my need
Girl you want me to bed, wish to hell I was dead
Cos you love me to hate you, yeah you love me to hate you
Girl you love me to hate you, and the more that I hate you I love you

You're like a cat on a hot tin roof, I love it when you scratch and bite
You got my heart in a hangman's noose, pull the rope and make it tight
Love's like a chain holdin' you to me, you're the lock, baby I'm the key
Don't wanna walk 'cause we're caught in a fantasy

[chorus]

It's a game of who needs who, who's on top, me or you
Pleasure and pain feel the same when the night is thru

[chorus]

Cos you love me to hate you, yeah you love me to hate you
Girl you love me to hate you, and the more that I hate you I love you

And the more that I hate you I love you
Yeah the more that I hate you I love you
