Young and dumb, truth and justice, fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off then you look away
Do you think this corruption will ever stop
What makes a person want to be a cop
Ran a red light, storm the house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry

Pick up a hooker and take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side
Sworn to serve and protect, forget the killing
Badge-wearing fascist villain
Pissed in the street, you bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry

The badge means you suck
A child lies there dead
As you look back, what goes through your head

Young and tough, truth and justice, fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off then you look away
He burned a flag, storm the house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry
Ran a red light, take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side

The badge means you suck
A child lies there dead
As you look back, what goes through your head

Talk to them, you can work it out
You better not even try it
You make a play for his gun
They'll kill you say it was a riot
RIOT

What's behind the badge?
