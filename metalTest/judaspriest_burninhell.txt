[Tipton/Downing]

Speak to me
Of those days I won't forget
Your worst dreams
Has just returned - to pay you back
I'm still laughing
There's not much else I can do
But one's thing's certain
I'm coming back for you

Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who you used it on
It's time to burn in hell

Say my name
I can hear you whisper
Not to blame?
You are going to blister
Scream in the night
I've been counting the days
It's so amusing
To see you again

Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who d'ya use it on
You're going to burn in hell

Die
Why?
Time to pay the price

Kill
I will
Have my sacrifice

Plead
With fear
I am getting near

Friend
Liar
Time to eat some fire

Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who d'ya use it on
You're going to burn in hell

Burn in hell
Burn in hell

Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who d'ya use it on
You're going to burn in hell

Burn in hell
Burn in hell

Snarl like a dog
You'll scream like a banshee
Stuck like a hog
You're gonna love me

Burn in hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in hell
You are going to blister
Burn in hell
Screaming like a banshee
Burn in hell
Burn
