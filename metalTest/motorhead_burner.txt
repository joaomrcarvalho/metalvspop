Riots in the burning street
Crystal night outside
Brutal music in the night, enough to make you cry
Nobody knows how it is to scream and drown the world
I am the midnight snake to bite your little girls

Outside in the distance, the city in the fire
See the houses burning down, mile after mile
I don't think you know about your future yet
I don't think you're gonna like the one you're going to get
Ghost rider in the sky

Burner

Lights outside my window, victims on the floor
Rats in all the bedrooms, thunder at the door
Nobody knows anything, kill and wear a smile
Here comes the pirates baby, don't' you touch that dial
You will never hurt me, you won't put me down
This ain't no circus and I sure don't need no clowns

I will be the one you can't be
I will see the things that you can't see
Demons blind your eyes

Burner

Beat me like a hammer, baby, stick me like a pig
Throw me to the lions, baby, wear me like a wig
I am not only one to walk into the fire
I would rather burn than let them make me a liar
I cannot be beaten, I cannot be like you
I cannot be otherwise, no matter what you do

I am the voice of broken glass
I am the voice to drive you mad at last
I am the truth, the liar turned around

Burner
Burner
Burner
Burner anyway
