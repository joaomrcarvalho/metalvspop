Just like the arctic circle
War in the snow unfolds
My death will carry on with you
I helped another madness
Endure screaming shouts
Wouldn't wanna wait for more
Bow to the master of snow!

Look at my kingdom
Tequila shots kill me
To the winter of decadence
The preacher of violence

First punch sent you flying
(Look at my kingdom)
Why are you so slow
(Tequila shots kill me)
A pitch in the fire
(To a winter of decadence)
That's how we roll!

I'll catch you dead in a sander
Wish me luck for I'm going anymore
To slay for the fortune as before
On the floor next to a sawblade
This is my fist now beating you to blood
Like I said, you won't hear anyone

This is the way we roll
At the fuckin northpole
We show no mercy
Doing a god damn toll

Look at my kingdom
Tequila shots kill me
To the winter of decadence
The preacher of violence

First punch sent you flying
(Look at my kingdom)
Why are you so slow
(Tequila shots kill me)
a pitch in the fire
(To a winter of decadence)
That's how we roll with a northpole throwdown

This is the way we roll
At the fuckin north pole
We show no mercy
This is the way we roll
At the fuckin north pole
We show no mercy
Dead men all in the snow!
Fuck!
