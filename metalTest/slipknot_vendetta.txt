I know my uses / I have my pride / But my heart is still untamed
I learned my lessons / I've conquered Death / I go on and I'm unashamed
I'll paint your bones to match my eyes / They're the darkest I have ever seen
Until I'm lucid, I can't be told
I know my voices / They tell me to BELIEVE

Another fucking accident out of control / All the attitudes will never change
My Imitations are leading the way
I can't accept that I still don't find this strange

In light of my ability to feel denial
I walk away from everything with just a smile
The Agony of Coming Home has gone away
It's Everywhere / It's Everyone / It's Every Day

ARE YOU READY FOR THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE

I beg your pardon / I'm out of the way / A new conspiracy has taken my place
So over and over, I smell the decay
Believe what you want to - The Cycle Stays The Same

In light of my ability to undermine
I walk away from apathy - I'm feeling fine
The Agony of Cynicism beckons me
It's Everywhere / It's Everyone / It's Everything

ARE YOU READY FOR THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE

LET'S - PRETEND - WE'RE NOT AT THE END
PRETEND - THAT WE HAVE NOTHING LEFT

ARE YOU READY FOR THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE

LET'S - PRETEND - WE'RE NOT AT THE END
PRETEND - THAT WE HAVE NOTHING LEFT
