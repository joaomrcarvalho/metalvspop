Wake up
It’s almost over
Something is taking me
Everytime I'm up it kills me
With day to day
Shockwaves shatter me

I don't beg in security
Get up and
Don’t look back now
Don’t look back now

We ride a dying star
Across a burning sea
We’re like a supernova now
The fire is burning in me
MASS HYSTERIA, MASS HYSTERIA

Giving up
I won’t stop fightning
Bring it on, it wont phase me
Everytime it makes me stronger
With day to day
Shockwaves shatter me

I don't beg in security
Get up and Don’t look back now
Don’t look back now

We ride a dying star
Across a burning sea
We’re like a supernova now
The fire is burning in me
MASS HYSTERIA, MASS HYSTERIA

Go on day to day
Stirring up the happy sorrow
Why does life got be this way?
Everytime I’m up it kills me
Somewhere deep, responding change
Manipulation rapid all around
Dark all these days
Calling on something to follow

Mass hysteria (Mass hysteria)
We ride a dying star
Across a burning sea
We’re like a supernova now
The fire is burning in me
MASS HYSTERIA, MASS HYSTERIA
