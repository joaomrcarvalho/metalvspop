There's a dog loose in the wood

Dogfish rising,
It's good for gnawing,
Right wing interlude,
In the 1990s
Thats got a nice groove to it there.

I saw a human hand,
Windmills like two,
Something at my left,
Screaming to fulfill
(Big scary muscles)
Post sniff scrunchies
What the fuck?

Dogfish rising
Burn them for their nipples
Another rubber Rolex
So skinny I knows
Who wrote these fucking lyrics?

Battery-powered power tool
Black & Decker dildos
Fully-covered pockets
Pop it with... ohhh...
God spoke to me!

Dogfish rising
Blistering cabbage
Poor fish-dog-thing
Poor thing crawls
Why take free lotion?

Back off fuck-head!
Redneck percussion

Dogfish rising
Cum are hard
Pinpoint penis blood
Quarter-inch off fat
What are you laughing at?

[?]

Fuck it!
That dogfish is dead
I'm getting out of here guys
See you later
Have a good life
Don't even bother trying to watch this
It pours the lotion on the skin
It pours the lotion on the skin
THE GODDAMN LOTION!
Yes, Mr. Burns?
Crusty, fuzzy nuts
Bye!
