When you got it, you know you got it
When it's gone, you know you lost it
Nobody ever switched your switch
Nobody ever scratches your itch
Out of time, serves you right
Where you gonna sleep tonight
Out of time, blinding light
Now you're gonna feel the bite...

Turned around again, turned around again
Turned around again
Out for blood, out for blood
Out to lunch and no damn good...

If you need it, you must believe it
When it's gone you can;t retrieve it
Can't see where it all went wrong
You don't know what's going on
Out of time, serves you right
Where you gonna sleep tonight
Out of time, blind at night
Now you're gonna feel the bite

Turned around again, turned around again
Turned around again
Out for blood, out for blood
Out to lunch and no damn good...

When it's on, you know it's on
When it bites, you know you're wrong
Don't feel good about yourself
Don't know if you're someone else
Out of time, serves you right
Where you gonna sleep tonight
Out of time, blind all right
Now you're gonna feel the bite

Turned around again, turned around again
Turned around again
Out for blood, out for blood
Out to lunch and no damn good...
Turned around again, turned around again
Turned around again
Out for blood, out for blood
Out to lunch and no damn good...
