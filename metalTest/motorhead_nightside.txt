Horror stalks the dark night
Keeps the world from our sight
We can't see all of the silent ones coming
To take the ultimate bite
No lucky charm will suffice
To keep the monsters at bay
No clove of garlic or crucifix ever
Kept the vampires away

Nightside, nightside
Open wide, open wide
Nightside, hell-born
Nightside, devil-spawn

Darkness, in our poor eyes
Helps the night to disguise
The legions of crawling &
Hopping black horrors
Who come to aid our demise
No lucky charms ever help
To keep us safe while we sleep
No incantation or pentacle ever
Kept the strong from the weak

Nightside, nightside.
Open wide, open wide
Nightside, hell-born
Nightside, devil-spawn
Nightside, nightside.
Demons ride, demons ride
Nightside, ripped and torn
Nightside, devil-spawn

Terror, afraid of the dark.
Hear the devil dog bark.
You cannot hope you can
Ever outrun them
And their teeth are ever so sharp

No way to save your poor self
No way to keep you immune
No magic ever produced will assist you
To outlive the full of the moon

Nightside, nightside
Open wide, open wide
Nightside, hell-born
Nightside, devil-spawn
Nightside, open wide
Nightside, devil-spawn
Nightside, nightside
