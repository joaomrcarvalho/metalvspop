I rode the highway to heartache
I took a trip on the ship of fools, woah yeah!
And I paid the price to have my way
'Cause money makes the rules, yeah!

Sing it!
Lay down!
I'm looking through ya
Stay down!
You got what you should
Pay now!
All that you never would
It feels good!

Hell or hallelujah!
No matter what you do
I'm running through ya
Yeah!

You said that love's never lasting
We surrender our hearts to lose, yeah
Time's up there's nobody askin'
This time I get to choose

Let me hear ya!
Lay down!
Don't say you're sorry
Stay down!
I knew that you would
Pay now!
Don't say you're misunderstood
It feels good

Hell or hallelujah!
No matter what you do
I'm running through ya
One more time!
Hell or hallelujah!
Come on, come on
The rest is up to you
It's overdue, ya

Listen!
One heart is breakin'
One chance I'm takin'
No lies, no fakin'
Goodbye, feels like it should!
It feels good!

Oh yeah!

Hey
One heart is breakin'
One chance I'm takin'
No lies, no fakin'
Goodbye, feels like it should!

Yeah, let me tell ya how it feels…
It feels good!

Hell or hallelujah!
No matter what you do
I'm running through ya
Come on, come on
Hell or hallelujah!
The rest is up to you
It's overdue, yeah!
