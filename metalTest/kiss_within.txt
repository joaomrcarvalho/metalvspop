Cry without tears
See without sight
Night without day
And every day's black as the night

Fly without wings
Feel without touch
Touch without feel
And everywhere nothing is real

I wanna see from within
I wanna be where I've been
I want a truth not a lie
I wanna live 'fore I die

Life without death
World without end
Sleep without dreams
And nothing is quite what it seems

I want something more than you'll know
Follow myself and go where you can never go
And I see though my eyes are closed

I wanna see from within
(Cry without tears)
I wanna be where I've been
(See without sight)
I want a truth not a lie
(Night without day)
I wanna live 'fore I die
(And everywhere nothing is real)
(Touch without feel and everywhere nothing is real)

Inside you without your blessing
Inside me is me confessing
Outside you is outside me
And inside there is no guarantee

I wanna see from within
I wanna be where I've been
I want a truth not a lie
I wanna live 'fore I die

I wanna see from within
(Life without death)
I wanna be where I've been
(World without end)
I want a truth not a lie
(Sleep without dreams)
I wanna live 'fore I die
(And nothing is quite what it seems)

I want something more than you'll know
Follow myself and go where you can never go

Cry without tears
Night without day
