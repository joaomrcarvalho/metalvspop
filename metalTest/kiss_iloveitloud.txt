Stand up, you don't have to be afraid
Get down, love is like a hurricane
Street boy, no I never could be tamed, better believe it
Guilty till I'm proven innocent
Whiplash, heavy metal accident
Rock on, I wanna be the president, 'cos

I love it loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, I don't want to compromise

Turn it up, hungry for the medicine
Two fisted to the very end
No more treated like aliens, we're not gonna take it 'cos

I love it loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, I don't want to compromise

Headlines jungle is the only rule
Front page roar of the nation cool
Turn it up, this is my attitude, take it or leave it yeah

Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, don't want to compromise
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, don't want to compromise

Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, don't want to compromise
