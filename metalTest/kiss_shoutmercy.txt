Hey!
I don't want a lover's heartache
I don't need nobody's sympathy
So come on get the party started
All I need is lying next to me

We got our own situation
Ready, and steady, to go
Come out, put out, get out
That's what we're all about

I want to hear you shout mercy (whoo-hoo)
I wanna get a little crazy (oh yeah)

Hey!

You got everything I'm after
Flesh and blood just like a fantasy (whoo-hoo)
Alright

So make my heart start beatin' faster
Never is and what can never be (whoo-hoo)
Mercy

You gotta a line to keep waitin'
How is it nobody sees
Come out, put out, get out
That's what we're all about

Yeah!

I want to hear you shout mercy (whoo-hoo)
I wanna get a little crazy (oh yeah)
We're gonna make a little exstacy, you and me (whoo-hoo)
That's what we're all about
Mercy (mercy)

Yeah!

C'mon (whoo-hoo)
Alright, alright (oh heay)
Mercy (whoo-hoo)
Mercy

Listen!
We got our own situation
Ready, and steady, to go
Come out, put out, get out
That's what we're all about

I want to hear you shout mercy (whoo-hoo)
I wanna get a little crazy (oh yeah)
We're gonna make a little exstacy, you and me (whoo-hoo)
That's what we're all about
Mercy (mercy)

I don't want a lover's heartache
I don't need nobody's sympathy
I don't want it
And I don't need it
Mercy
Oh yeah!
