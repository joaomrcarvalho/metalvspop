Gone out of sight there's only darkness in my eyes
Hey, hey, where are the loosers now
Gone inside outlaws every day a losing streak
Every day they tell us lies

The sky, the sky is crushing you
The wall, the walls are touching you too
Even the floor is clutching you
And all the eyes that ever closed are open,
and they're watching you

Blind justice hears the voice of bribery all right,
Hey, hey, but she don't see the joke
There's only treason left when you put out the light
You can't see who it was that spoke

The sky, the sky is crushing you
The wall, the walls are touching you too
Even the floor is clutching you
And all the eyes you ever closed are open,
and they're watching you

There ain't no windows in the hallways anymore
Hey, hey, the news is awful bad
Two schizophrenics but I can't see them at all
Anymore and I'll go mad

The sky is crushing you
And now the walls are closing in on you
Even the floor is tripping you
And all the eyes you ever closed are open,
and they're watching you
