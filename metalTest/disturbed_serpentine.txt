See the dogs come running
Smelling blood now
To an open sore
On a parasite
Countless hearts have fallen
Hard to number
Damnation’s whore
Is looking for a victim tonight
With an angry soul
And a wicked design
Your will cannot endure
And your heart is torn away

[Chorus:]
I was caught up in the moment
You were alone and
You seemed to harness the light
Even though I felt cold inside
When you told me it would be alright
I had given up control and
I didn’t focus hard enough to see
The warning signs
Your heart is serpentine

Damn what I’m becoming
One of them now
Just an opened door
On an endless night
Dark desire burning
In my blood now
How can I be sure?
I don’t know if I’ll be able to fight
With a tortured soul
And an honest design
My will cannot endure
If my heart is torn away

[Chorus]

Now that I’ve been torn apart
Will there be an end to this?
Will there finally be release?
Will I finally rest in peace?
I’m determined to believe
My prayers will be received
With a tortured soul
And an honest design
My will cannot endure
As my heart is torn away

[Chorus]

The warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
Evil personified
Your heart is serpentine
