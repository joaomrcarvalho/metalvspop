I, wishing and wishing away as you go
I, wishing and wishing away as you go

I don't see nothing but pain and misery
Cause you are the one for me
Why can't it all be true
Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie
Why can't it all be true
Why can't it all be true

I, wishing and wishing away as you go
I, wishing and wishing away as you go

Suddenly I believe
Your were the one for me
Graciously you go through
My closed heart's artery
Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie
Why can't it all be true
Why can't it all be true

I've been wishing away as you
I've been wishing away as you
I've been wishing away as you go

I don't see nothing but pain and misery
Cause you are the one for me
Why can't it all be true
Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie
Why can't it all be true
Why can't it all be true

Wishing and wishing away as you go
Wishing and wishing away as you go
Wishing and wishing away as you go
Wishing and wishing away as you go
Wishing and wishing away as you go
Wishing and wishing away as you go
As you go
As you go
As you go
