Like a fly to a spider, you're under the spell
It's the game and the liar, for those who toll the bell
You're more than just a name, you fight for the right
Like a moth to a flame, you see the bait you bite
You're restless and wild and walkin' the line
You're not just another pretty face
Need an answer fast and you're runnin' out of time
And the night goes on for days

Young and wasted - ooh yeah, ooh yeah - young and wasted
You been branded by the iron, you been cut by the knife
There's a monkey on your back runnin' up and down your spine
Up and down your spine
You hunger for the fire and run with the pack
But you know damn well there ain't no turnin' back
Ain't no turnin' back, no no

You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
You laugh in the face of the fates
Fallen angels spread their wings,
so you cross the gates of hate
Young and wasted - I can almost taste it,
I can almost taste it
Young and wasted - ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
You laugh in the face of the fates
Fallen angels spread their wings, so let the heaven say,
young and wasted
Young and wasted - I can almost taste it,
I can almost taste it
Young and wasted [repeats out]
