His wicked Highness, born from disaster, to dominate and to kill
A glistening, murder-machine; false majesty, standing perfectly still
A blitzkrieg; raining down evil on a mountain of black ice
Like a good ole fashioned beating within Inches of your life

Alone and left abandoned with the sentence you've been handed
All your angels will ignore you as your life flashes before you
Even still you keep on fighting through the thunder and the lightning
And now Heaven sends its love your sudden death from above

Once frozen like a prisoner depraved, perched high atop the lithospheres
Set free from beneath the depths of hell, bequeathing man nothing but despair
The beast is genetically programmed, time to destroy, time to go berserk
To see the end of all wars, to see the end of the earth

Stopping at nothing, punch-drunk from the blood that he's tasted
Tearing your soul apart, not one bit of your pain will be wasted
Now death descends upon you like a bloody white dove
Bringing your retribution, your sudden death from above

[Chorus]
