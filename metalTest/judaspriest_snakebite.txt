Two bit sniper
Kiss the viper
Lie in wait as you take the bait
Feel you getting nearer
And I'm coiled up aiming to bite

The clock starts ticking
When you start gunning
I strike so fast
You won't see me coming

Get ready - ready for a snake bite
Get ready - ready for a snake bite

I'll kill your will
You can run till
There's no escape when you taste my venom
I'll track you down till there's no place left to hide

The clock starts ticking
When you start gunning
I'll strike so fast
You won't see me coming

Get ready - ready for a snake bite
Get ready - ready for a snake bite

Undertaker meet you maker
I'm cutting loose and let fly
Double dealer moving in nearer
It's time to say goodbye

Feel my poison
Your misfortune
Flowing through you paralyzing
Every vein in your body
Till your brain's ready to explode

The clock starts ticking
When you start gunning
I'll strike so fast you won't see me coming

Get ready - get ready - ready for a snake bite
Get ready - get ready - ready for a snake bite

You won't see me coming

Get ready - get ready - ready for a snake bite
Get ready - get ready - ready for a snake bite

You won't see me coming
