Precious finger she knows how to hold the poison
Lick it dip it and for no particular reason
She crawls on the floor slides against the door
Press your fingers over blossom and it's season

Doesn't matter she'll be doin it her way
Doesn't care if it's a 10 or a 2-way
Doesn't matter she'll be doin it her way
Every night every day

Never meant to show up here anyway
Only fuckin you till the seasons change

Treasure deep between the places that you hold dear
Can't it hurt to act as if we are in love here?
Lie across this chair fingers everywhere
To define all the angels up above here

Doesn't matter she'll be doin it her way
Doesn't care if it's a 10 or a 2-way
Doesn't matter she'll be doin it her way
Every night every day

Never meant to show up here anyway
Only fuckin you till the seasons change

When you cum (be a good girl)
Hold your breath (make it last long)
It's a mess (and it's gone)
The little death girl

Never meant to show up here anyway
Only fuckin you till the seasons change
Never meant to show up here anyway
Only fuckin you till the seasons change
