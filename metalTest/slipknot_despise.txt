Despise!!! 

Maze...psychopathic daze...I create this waste 
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic 
ways...can't escape this place...I deny your face 
Sweat gets in my eyes, lash out at all I despise 

HANDSONMYFACEOVERBEARINGICAN'TGETOUT 

Lost...ran at my own cost...hearing laughter, scoffed 
Searching from the rush, detached from such and such 
Bleak...standing on my feet...listening incomplete 
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you dog

Never - ever - surrender - I WON'T ALLOW IT! [x3]
Never - ever - surrender - DESPISE 
My state of mind gets so one-sided [x4]
Despise! [x4]

Cut me - show me - enter - I am 
Willing and able and never any danger to myself 
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain 
Or was my tolerance a phase? 
Empathy, out of my way 
I can't die 

Never - ever - surrender - I WON'T ALLOW IT! [x3]
Never - ever - surrender - DESPISE 
My state of mind gets so one-sided [x4]

Despise! 

Truth hurts when it's in your face 
Are you afraid of it?
