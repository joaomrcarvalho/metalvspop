Hey! [x6]

Been watching for a long time, seeing the world join forces to the edge of calamity
How many of the wars have started over mankind's area we call religion?
Too many of our children have died in the never ending fight for territory

Are we born to violence?
Can we stop in time?
They say you will want to remain on your side
You'll be starting a war now if you cross that line
Turn around or face my reprisal for I have determined that this is mine

Hey! [x6]

Been hurting for a long time feeling my heart torn open from the lack of humanity
Insanity on both sides reaping the path that guarantees our own extinction
Hate added to the stockpile filling the world with enemies, a constant battle

In the face of violence, they omit their pride
They say you will want to remain on your side
You'll be starting a war now if you cross that line
Turn around or face my reprisal for I have determined that this is mine

Ooooohhhhhh [x2]

You will want to remain on your side
You'll be starting a war now if you cross that line
Turn around and face my reprisal for I have determined that this is mine

We will not be broken this time
We will force the whole world to testify
Stand your ground or face our reprisal for we have determined that this is...
