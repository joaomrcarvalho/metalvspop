You're paralyzed with your disguise
You feed on the lies when they tell you
Gotta break away from the numbing pain
Succumb to the rage that's inside you
You're hypnotized demoralized
Believe every lie that they sell you
Start channelling whatever will remains
Discern from what's fiction and what is true

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes!

You've lost your sense from the emptiness
You do as the headlines compel you
Come whole again and let the war begin
Destroy the veneer that surrounds you
There's no defense for your recklessness
You stare as the proof lies before you
Why can't you see, are you afraid to be
Exposed to the demons around you?

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes!

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes!

You would all be runnin'
In a world you cannot hide
That the end is comin'
For the limping standing in line
Overcoming
Let the fury build inside
It can all be broken
If you'd only open your eyes

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes!

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes!
