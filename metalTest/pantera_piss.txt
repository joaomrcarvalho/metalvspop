Half assed for most his life
Done nothing but stand
Just because he's so small so
No one will give him a hand
The kinda guy that would steal your cast
And buy a burning house
Then call you up and invite you in
And jerk you off with a sandpaper hand

I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I'd throw that trash away
Because a runt like that is piss in the wind
My fist would be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool
I'd stomp his ass for free
Because a punk like that is piss in the wind

Piss in the wind

A go-getter who ain't got none
A legend in his mind
Always the one to invite himself
And then just left behind
Someone must've clipped his balls
Or wiped his ass of his life
A self centered procrastinator
Attention seeker who's got nothing at all

I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I'd throw that trash away
Because a runt like that is piss in the wind
My fist would be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool
I'd stomp his ass for free
Because a punk like that is piss in the wind
