Yeah!

[Verse]
Can you feel your heart pound?
Do you feel it beat?
Can you feel the earth quake
Underneath your feet?

[Verse]
Can you feel it burning?
Do you understand?
You can make the whole world
Bow to your command

Here comes the sound of thunder on the way
A million voices shouting, let me hear you say...

[Chorus]
I'm a lion (I'm a lion), in the street (in the street)
Made of fire, made of heat
I'm an animal and I'm free
No rules (no rules), no bounds (no bounds)
Nothing's gonna hold me down
I'm an animal and I'm free

[Verse]
Are you superstitious?
Live on fantasy
Don't need no ball of crystal
To tell you what you see

Let others take the road that leads nowhere
Stand up, raise your fist up in the air

[Chorus]

[Guitar Solo]

Let others take the road that leads nowhere (yeah)
Stand up, raise your fist up in the air

I'm a lion (I'm a lion), in the street (in the street)
Made of fire, made of heat
I'm an animal and I'm free
No rules (no rules), no bounds (no bounds)
Nothing's gonna hold me down
I'm an animal and I'm free...
Yeah...
