Running through the darkness,
Won't do you no good to flee,
Stalking through the golden state,
Who's bitch do you want to be,
Can't run, can't hide,
Gonna get you wait and see,

You know I'm weird, I know I'm weird,
I'm crazy
Now feel your backbone shiver,
Lucky thing for you babe I'm so lazy,
But I'm gonna pull your trigger.

Look over your shoulder,
And all the windows too,
Bow down to the golden calf,
Which bitch is the one for you,
What you need is extra speed,
Cause I'm gonna hit on you,

You know I'm weird, I know I'm weird,
I'm crazy
Now feel your backbone shiver,
Lucky thing for you babe I'm so lazy,
But I'm gonna pull your trigger.

Know you can't stop,
Move it on over,
But that's another story,
Cause I knew your mama

Out here in the city,
Just half a mile behind,
Searching for the golden rose,
Which bitch would you like to find,
You can't run forever,
And you're still on my mind.

You know I'm weird, I know I'm weird,
I'm crazy
Now feel your backbone shiver,
Lucky thing for you babe I'm so lazy,
But I'm gonna pull your trigger.

You know I'm weird, I know I'm weird,
I'm crazy
Now feel your backbone shiver,
Lucky thing for you babe I'm so lazy,
But I'm gonna pull your trigger.
