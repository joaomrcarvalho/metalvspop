Forged in the black country
Under blood red skies
We all had our dream to realise

Driving in that transit
Down to holy Joe's
Used to lose our head
While metal flowed

Nothing held us back or dared to try
Something in our blood
Won't let us die

We built our world of metal
Watched it grow
Fuelled the fury solid to the bone

Gotta deal with the devil
'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil
From a heart made of steel

Rollin' down the m-way
Took it to the smoke
Bangin' heads there
'til we all went broke

When we don the leather, and the whips and chains
Nothing matters more
We can't be tamed

Fighting through the din and accolades
Turn the phase around with razor blades

Watched the movement grow
Into one voice
Took on all the world
It had no choice

Gotta deal with the devil
'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil
From a heart made of steel

We hit at night
You're in our sight
Then we can feel
What we've been waiting for
Let me hear you roar

Upon this stage
We let it rage
And for a time we leave the world behind
To be with our own kind

Gotta deal with the devil
'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil
From a heart made of steel
