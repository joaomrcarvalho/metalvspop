Swimming on the surface
It's a hell of a lot safer up here
Ain't prepared to dive
And uncover all my darkest fears
This ain't no covert operation
I don't have that much concentration

Staring at the clock
And my patience is wearing thin
One more down the gullet
Keeps me from jumping out of my skin
This ain't no covert operation
I'm lost in this fog of contradiction

I toast to the extras
I drink to them cause they don't talk too much
They fill up space and entertain
And when I cut em loose, they don't make a fuss
They all add up to zero in my mind
They're just here to cure the boredom for the night

Now sometimes this leaves me feeling hollow
That's when I take refuge in my pillow
This ain't no covert operation
I'm not even ready for confession

I toast to the extras
I drink to them cause they don't talk too much
They fill up space and entertain
And when I cut em loose, they don't make a fuss
They all add up to zero in my mind
They're just here to cure the boredom for the night

That's right
