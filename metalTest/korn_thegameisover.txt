I feel the void 'cause I知 on a mission
I am no hero, I just have a vision
To liberate and destroy your system
The game is over, the game is over

I知 over it now, amusing the crowd
I知 willing to die to see you fall
Power unbound, I知 taking you down
I知 willing to die to see you fall

I am a threat to the opposition
I am no hero, I just have a vision
To terminate and restore this kingdom
The game is over, the game is over

I知 over it now, amusing the crowd
I知 willing to die to see you fall
Power unbound, I知 taking you down
I知 willing to die to see you fall

All I see while I知 dreaming
Is a man I wanna destroy
There痴 no use for you hiding
I will be there behind every door

Are you prepared for the fighting?
'Cause I知 rising up, so fed up
I gave up on you long ago

I知 over it now, amusing the crowd
I知 willing to die to see you fall
Power unbound, I知 taking you down
I知 willing to die to see you fall

I知 over it now, amusing the crowd
I知 willing to die to see you fall
Over it now, amusing the crowd
I知 willing to die to see you fall
