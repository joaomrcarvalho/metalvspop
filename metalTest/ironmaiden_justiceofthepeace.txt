Have you heard on the news 
Another let off madman 
Another screw on the loose 
Is it the judge or the badman 

What's the matter these days 
No one has the courage to put them away 
Nobody has any faith 
'Cause there's a breakdown of justice and order

Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace 

Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace

When I remember back the memories of yesterday 
With all the friends and all the times 
When people were carefree 
And walking down the street 
When everyone knew everyone 
And all the houses doors were open 
No had to care, those days are gone 
Those days are gone 
Those days are gone

Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace 

Oooh! 
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace 
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace

I long for the times when you could 
Wander down the street unharmed 
When poeple didn't have much money 
But didn't seem to care 
It must be the cynic in me 
But I don't really like things now 
The violence, the attitudes 
Aggression that you see everyday 
A sick society looks the other way, Yeah!
