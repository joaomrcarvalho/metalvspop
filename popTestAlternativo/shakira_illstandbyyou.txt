Oh why you look so sad
Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don稚 be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
Cause I致e seen the dark side too

When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less

I値l stand by you
I値l stand by you
Won稚 let nobody hurt you
I値l stand by you

So if you're mad get mad
Don稚 hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey, what you got to hide
I get angry too
Well I知 a lot like you

When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
Cause even if you're wrong

I値l stand by you
I値l stand by you
Won稚 let nobody hurt you
I値l stand by you
Take me in into you darkest hour
And I値l never desert you
I値l stand by you

And when, when the night falls on you, baby
You feeling all alone
You won't be on your own

I値l stand by you
Won稚 let nobody hurt you

Take me in into you darkest hour
And I値l never desert you
