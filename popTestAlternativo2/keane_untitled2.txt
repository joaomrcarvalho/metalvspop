You chewed me up. and you spit me out
The foolish boy that I am
So I chose to wander around and around
And make myself a man

I thought the world could be changed by
A good song and a smile
But its been this way such a long time
So maybe I’m wrong

So long ago it must be
You're still the one that's troubling me
And still so far, so far away
I sat with a tear in my hand on a day
So long ago

Inside I am an ogre
With the simple thoughts of a child
I say what I think and I need to be loved
But I guess that's not your style

So long ago it must be
That you're still the one that's troubling me
And still so far, so far away
I sat with a tear in my hand on a day
So long ago
