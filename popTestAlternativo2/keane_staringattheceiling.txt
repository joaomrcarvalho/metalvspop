Things will seem much better in the morning light,
Love will be much easier to own.
Things will look much better in the pale sunlight.
We can be together like before.

You just need time to forget.
You just need time to explain.
You just need time to forget yourself again.

You're lying on the floor and
Staring at the ceiling.
Thinking of the place you
have never seen before.

Remember when you held
someone for the first time.
Remember when the spike was all we had.

And you want life without death.
And you want love without pain.
And you want time to go back and start again.

Lying on the floor and
Staring at the ceiling.
Thinking of the place you
have never seen before.

Thinking of your own friends.
And waiting for the feeling.
Waiting for the old and turning to return.

These days you don't know who you are.
These days you don't know where you are.
These days we don't know who we are.

So meet me by the wall,
where we used to go.

You're lying on the floor and
Staring at the ceiling.
Thinking of the place you
have never seen before.

Waiting for the phonecall.
And waiting for the feeling.
Waiting for the old rage
and turning to return
