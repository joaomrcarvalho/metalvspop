You're living in a place you lived behind
Going round in circles all the time
Can see the way your head it's like you're blind
So open your eyes and
Time realign just what you got
With what you nearly had and what you want
You fall asleep and then the moment's gone
So open your eyes and:

[K'Naan - rap]
Looking back
You always seem to be looking back
Feels like your mind's always somewhere else
You're always looking over your shoulder

Think about the places you could never been
Beauty in the faces that you never see
As you lad sleepy
How the moment flies
So open your eyes and:

[K'Naan - rap]

Don't waste your time, no
Don't waste your time just looking back
You always seem to be looking back
Feels like your mind's always somewhere else
You're always looking over your shoulder
Looking back
You always seem to be looking back
Feels like your mind's always somewhere else
You're always looking over your shoulder

[K'Naan - rap]

Don't waste your time just looking back
You always seem to be looking back
Feels like your mind's always somewhere else
You're always looking over your shoulder
You always seem to be looking back
Feels like your mind's always somewhere else
You're always looking over your shoulder

You're always looking back
Over, and over, and over
You're always looking back
