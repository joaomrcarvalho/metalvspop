I watched you walking
Late in the day
Where old men were talking
Binding up the hay
I watched you drinking
Shutting your eyes and thinking
Late in the day

You were signalling with your hands
Going, going out of my way
You're out of my way
Where you're banging on hollow land
A hunter-gatherer and
Blowing, blowing out of the rain
In out of the rain

Ooooh, Oooh

After several uneventful days
We gathered all the faithful
To come and have their say
Drinking, greeting
Sellers and farmers meeting
Late in the day

You were signalling with your hand
Going, going out of my way
You're out of my way
Where you're banging on hollow land
A hunter-gatherer and
Blowing, blowing out of the rain
In out of the rain

I wish all my words were unsaid
I wish all my words were unsaid
If I could eat my words would I be standing here
Biding my time and feeling so young
In the summer when the rain begins
Better hurry, don’t bide your time
Better get all your winter things
Better gather, don’t bide your time
In the summer when the rain begins
Better hurry, don’t bide your time
Better get all your winter things
Better gather, don’t bide your time
