I see I'm a long, long way from where I am supposed to be
And frankly I'm still happy here
I know where I'd rather be

So whether you're lonely like the sun
Or you rely on everyone
There's no need to be lonely
There's no need to be low
We're lines and maps and cities and songs

Feel fear the closer it comes
Till I don't know how it feels
Till I don't know how it feels
Till I don't know

A million miles from anywhere
But anyway
I don't deny the more you see
The more I try to change your mind

So whether you're lonely like the sun
Or you rely on everyone
There's no need to be lonely
There's no need to be low
We're lines and maps and cities and songs

Feel fear the closer it comes
Till I don't know how it feels
Till I don't know how it feels
Till I don't know

But I'm here whenever you say
Ever you say

Oh, little by little she blows
And that's the end of it
And little by little she blows
And that's the end of it
