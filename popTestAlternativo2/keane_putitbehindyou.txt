Times goes by at such a pace
It's funny how it's easy to forget her face
You hide the cracks, the facts will find you
Turn your back and leave the lonely days behind you now

You better put it behind you now
You better put it behind you now
Too much to hold on, hold on to
You better put it behind you now

All the things you took for granted
Hit you like a bullet in the gut
You can't get up
Well are you gonna even try?
Cos if you never even try
Time will pass you by

You better put it behind you now
You better put it behind you now
Too much to hold on, hold on to (Hold on, hold on to)
You better put it behind you now
You better put it behind you now
Too much to hold on, to hold on to (Hold on, hold on to)
You better do what's best for you

Don't care what she said and (Better put it behind you now, better put it behind you now)
Only in your head (Hold on, hold on to)
Time will help you out (Better put it behind you now, you better put it behind you now)
Still you don't see how (Hold on, hold on to)

You better put it behind you now
You better put it behind you now
Too much to hold on, to hold on to
You better do what's best for you
