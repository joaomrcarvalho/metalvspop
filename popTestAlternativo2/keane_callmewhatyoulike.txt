There's no believing
And no reason why
Well I'm superstitious
And I can fly

There's nothing to see
And nothing to hide
I'm scared and surrounded
I only need a while

To float through the ceiling
And into the sky
Call me what you like
I just wanna be there with you
All the time
Do you wanna be here with me
All the time?

And there's no believing
And no real surprise
Well I am a ghost here
Appearing in the night

To float through the ceiling
And into your eyes
Call me what you like
I just wanna be there with you
All the time
Do you wanna be here with me
All the time?

I float through the ceiling
And into your lives
Call me what you like
I just wanna be there with you
All the time
Do you wanna be here with me?
