Down in the old town
When my mind was wandering
Round empty hallways
When will I be one again?
You're just, making it harder for yourself
Making it easy for everyone else
Making it easy for me

In the old time
You'll never be in and you get never get out
You learn from the family
You'll never be in and you get never get out
To run to the end of the earth

Under the archways
Where my mind is wallowing
Down to the country
Where I will be well again
You're just, making it harder for yourself
Making it easy for everyone else
Making it easy for me

In the old time
You'll never be in and you get never get out
You learn from the family
You'll never be in and you get never get out
To run to the end of the earth
To the end of the earth and run
To the end of the earth

Build me a home underground
Free from light and sound
Build me a home in the air
I will run, to the end, to the end
To the end of the earth
And run, to the end, to the end
To the end of the earth
And run, to the end of the earth
