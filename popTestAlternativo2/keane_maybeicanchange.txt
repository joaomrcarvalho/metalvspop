Now, will it ever be the same again?
And it will it ever feel right?
The false start, then I try to twist your heart
But I supposed it always knows

I know how I let you down
But maybe I can change this time around
This heart and these hands are mine
Maybe I can change this time

Soon, I'm gonna be an older man
And I will struggle to remember
The blank space when I tried to see your face
The blinded eye, I can't replace

I know how I let you down
But maybe I can change this time around
This heart and these hands are mine
Maybe I can change this time

Oh why can't we go back again?
Rain, rain, will you ever go away?
Come back again some other day

I know how I let you down
But maybe I can change this time around
This heart and these hands are mine
Maybe I can change this time

But I've tired you out with the things I do
But I can change, and change you too
But still somehow, I have to say
"I'm on my way"
Gone
