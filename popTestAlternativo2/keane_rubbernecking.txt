I come to, there will be no more drowning
Help, colourless and cowering

You should understand me
When you're understanding

And through all the tears
Should you be alone

Right back, I hope he will pull through
Stand back, first aid is useful

You should understand me
How was I so stupid?

And through all the tears
Should you be alone
After all the tears
Should you be alone

Yes, there's going to be a drowning
Yes, there's going to be a drowning

Half wasted
Face painted
Hold my hand

There will be no more
Please move along
There will be no more
Please move along, oh...
