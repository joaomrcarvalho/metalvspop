I believe
You might stumble and come closer

I like to wake alone
To lie and turn to stone
Comfort me, come to me
I won't go on

I like to walk along
To keep my head screwed on
Well I'm the best, so well done me
I won't go on

Believing, believing
I believe
You might stumble and come closer now

If I stay then I'm alone
If I go then it will mean
Waiting on my own
It's the pattern of my life
When you care and you cannot feel
And you know that it's for real
You just leave me on my own
To live the pattern of my life

I believe
You might stumble and come closer now

Make time to be
All this and more for me
Well you're the best so well done you
I won't go on

Believing, believing
I believe
You might turn from your love, wait around

If I go then I'm alone
If I stay then it will mean
Waiting on my own
It's the pattern of my life
When you care and you cannot feel
When you know that it's for real
So you leave me on my own
To live the pattern of my life

I believe
You might turn from your love wait around

If I stay here I'm alone
If I go then it will mean
Waiting on my own
It's the pattern of my life
When you care and you cannot feel
When you know that it's for real
You just leave me on my own
To live the pattern of my life

If I stay then I'm alone
If I go then it will mean
Waiting on my own
It's the pattern of my life
When you care and you cannot feel
And you know that it's for real
So you leave me on my own
To live the pattern of my life

Woah...
I believe
You might stumble and come closer now
