[Beyoncé:]
Drink from me, drink from me
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Symphony
Then we'll shoot across the sky
We're on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
Then we'll shoot across the sky

[Coldplay:]
Oh, angels sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was hurt, withered, dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Coldplay & Beyoncé:]
So drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
We're on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low

[Coldplay:]
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

[Coldplay & Beyoncé:]
Oh, angels sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

[Coldplay & Beyoncé:]
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low

[Coldplay:]
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

[Beyoncé & Coldplay:]
So high, so high
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

[Beyoncé:]
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
