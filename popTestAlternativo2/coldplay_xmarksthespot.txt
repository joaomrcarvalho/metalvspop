(So I reach for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Coming home and I'm finding no peace

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm out of luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know what you've got

I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been innocent but a sinner in me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm not

I just put my hands up to the sky, I'm feeling like
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I just put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) And I know, and I know, and I know
(So I reach for it) I know what I've got
X marks the spot

I just put my hands up to the sky, I'm feeling like
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
