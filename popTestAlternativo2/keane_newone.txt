I am the one
I am the only one that I care about
She is the one
She was always the one
To go running around in another land
She go home

I am the one
I am always the one that I recognize
And you are the one for me
Always the one
I go running around in another land

I go home too
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I'll take on to know that I was so
If you want to run away
I'll take back all that I'll say
I'll take on to know that I was so

I am the one
I am always the one to be recognized
She was the one
She was always the one
To go running around in another land
She go home too

Will you miss me when I'm all gone?
I'll take on to know that I was so
Well you want to run away
I'll take back all that I'll say
I'll take on to know that I was so

I saw the full moon sinking
I saw the full moon sinking

If you want to run away
I'll take back all that I'll say
I'll take on to know that I was so
Well she wants to look away
She wants to run away
I'll take on to know that I was so

I saw the full moon sinking
I saw the full moon sinking
