Your face in a dream returns
Once in a lifetime comes
And it passes by

I’m never on your side
And you must be blind
If you don’t know why

She'll always take you for granted
A voice in the back of my mind said
You could be waiting your whole life
For her to open her eyes

...music pause...

I’m never on your side
And you must be blind
If you don’t know why

She'll always take you for granted
A voice in the back of my mind said
You could be waiting your whole life
For her to open her eyes
For her to open her eyes

She'll always take you for granted
A voice in the back of my mind said
You could be waiting your whole life
For her to open her eyes
For her to open her eyes

(get ready for the best part!)
