Time to leave this town
Now your dreams have all let you down
No one here will miss you now
Time to wake up and look around

He used to be a lovely boy
Lovely boy, lovely boy
He used to be a lovely boy

Turn away and turn a head
Just a hopeless dreamer she said
Eyes of cloud and feet of lead
Find a shore that needs you instead

He used to be a lovely boy
Lovely boy, lovely boy
He used to be a lovely boy

Time on your hands
World at your feet
No adventure left incomplete

Find a place where you can hide
From the love that holds you inside
Time's so unkind
Like an old friend leaves you behind

He used to be a lovely boy
Lovely boy, lovely boy
He used to be a lovely boy

Time on your hands
