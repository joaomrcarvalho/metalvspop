In a pearl grey room one afternoon
One afternoon what are you going to do?
I hang on your words but there's nothing new

You take a beautiful thing
Pull off a wing, pull off a wing
A safety pin
They never shine quite as bright again

But you haven't told me anything
That I didn't already know
No you haven't said a single thing
That I didn't already know

Everything I love is stuck in the mud
Stuck in the mud, stuck in a rut
Not a piece in your puzzle or a paper cut

So same time next week
A kiss on the cheek, kiss on the cheek
And say after me
Everything's tied up nice and neat

But you haven't told me anything
That I didn't already know
No you haven't sold me anything
That I didn't already own

I feel for you
I really do
Nothing turns out
like you want it to
No words can mend
This fix I'm in
Hearing those words
That I'll never play
Right between the eyes
I don't feel a thing

But you haven't told me anything
That I didn't already know
No you haven't said a single thing
That I didn't already know

No you haven't told me anything
No you haven't told me anything
No you haven't told me anything
No you haven't told me anything
