Well, you were happy where you were
But that girl she reeled you in
This town was never good enough
'Cause she was gonna see everything
And if you ever spoke of love
She just smiled and put you down
'Cause she was making all the plans
She had a vision of light and sound

She said the neon on the river will light my way
And all the things that we've been dreaming of, we'll make it real one day
So save your money, pack your bag
We better run before we disappear
She took the train into the city but you're still here

You hear a song that takes you back
To some long forgotten night
And friends who said they had your back
But they just turned and ran and let you fight
And on the bowling alley wall
You used all your smartest lines
But they've been painted over now
Looks like you're gonna get left behind

She said the neon on the river will light my way
And all the things that we've been dreaming of, we'll make them real one day
So save your money, pack your bag
I want to run with you on Stamford Hill
She took the train into the city but you stood still

You stood still above the track
You knew as you watched her go
That she was never coming back
You stop to places that you know
You said you were scared of heights
And that you didn't want to go
Where everyone else goes

She said the neon on the river will light my way
And everything that we've been dreaming of, we'll make it real one day
So save your money, pack your bag
We better run before we disappear
She took the train into the city but you're still here
She took the train into the city but you're still here
