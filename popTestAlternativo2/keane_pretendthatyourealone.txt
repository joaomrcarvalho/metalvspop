We are just the monkeys, who fell out of the trees
We are blisters on the earth
We are not the flowers, we're the strangling weeds
In the meadow

And love is just our way of looking out for ourselves
When we don't want to live alone
So step into the vacuum, tear off your clothes
And be born again

Pretend that you're alone now
And everything's gone
Just animal reflex
There's noone looking on
Forget about fashion
Forget about the law
Pretend that you're alone now

I wonder what I'd do, if I could wake up every morning
With a clean slate
I'd burn through the cities, I'd tear through the towns
Cos there's no deals to make
So break out of the cages, the delicate structures
We cling to all our lives
Cos we are just the monkeys, who fell out of the trees
When we were trying to fly

Pretend that you're alone now
And everything's gone
Just primal desire
No right and no wrong
Forget about the future
Forget about blame
Pretend that you're alone now
Pretend that you're alone now

She's not waiting for tomorrow
And she has no love in her eyes
Oh no, I wanna come down right now
But oh no(?), I wanna get out right now

Oh oh!

Pretend that you're alone now
And everything's gone
Just animal reflex
There's noone looking on
Forget about religion
Forget about shame
Pretend that you're alone now

No numbers in your phone now
There's nothing going on
Just primal desire
No right and no wrong
Forget about fashion
Forget about fame
Pretend that you're alone now
Pretend that you're alone now
Pretend that you're alone now

Do do do do...
