Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up
Up and up

Down upon a canvas, working in a meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange peel
Up and up
Up and up

See a pearl form a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood
It's in your blood

Underneath the storm, an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up
Up and up, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and float, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and float
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up
Up and up

How can people suffer? How can people part?
How can people struggle? How can people
Break your heart?
Break your heart, oh

Yes I wanna grow, yes I wanna feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to
Heal it up
Heal it up, oh

Try and see the forest, there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love
Just need love

When the going is rough, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and float, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together right no
Gonna get it, get it together and float
Gonna get it, get it together and go

'Cause you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it's mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and float, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together and float
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and float, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
We're gonna get it, get it together and float
We're gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up

Oh

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain, when you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up
