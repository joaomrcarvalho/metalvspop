High on the bell tower 
I took my view 
Over the downtowns 
On the avenues 

Where the streets are wide 
And the people thrive 
And its further to fall down 
Cause you fly so high 

I've never seen such a beauty 
I've never seen such clear skies 
I've never seen such high hopes 
I've never seen such tired eyes 

And I wish that I could be 
Everything you are 
Everything you are 

Down in the delta 
The city wakes 
Turns on the TV 
As the ... 

Where the streets are burned 
From the hot summer sun 
And there's nowhere to run to 
When your time has come 

I've never seen such a beauty 
I've never seen such clear skies 
I've never seen such high hopes 
I've never seen such tired eyes 

Open wounds of piece by piece 
All those flesh all over me 
Take my pills and went to sleep 
Oh, and I sang myself to sleep 

And I wish that I could be 
Everything you are 
Everything you are 
And I wish that I could see 
The world the way you do 
As selfishly as you 

Oooh 

And I wish that I could be 
Everything you are 
Everything you are 
And I wish that I could stick 
My faith the way you do 
As certainly as you 

The sky is going to fall on you 
The sky is going to fall on you 
The sky is going to fall on you 
On you, on you. 
The sky is going to fall on you 
The sky.
